all right jim . your quarterlies look very good . how are things at the library ? 
so you ' ve come to the master for guidance ? is this what you ' re saying , grasshopper ? 
all right . well , let me show you how it ' s done . 
 [ on the phone ] yes , i ' d like to speak to your office manager , please . yes , hello . this is michael scott . i am the regional manager of dunder mifflin paper products . just wanted to talk to you manager - a - manger . [ quick cut scene ] all right . done deal . thank you very much , sir . you ' re a gentleman and a scholar . oh , i ' m sorry . ok . i ' m sorry . my mistake . [ hangs up ] that was a woman i was talking to , so . . . she had a very low voice . probably a smoker , so . . . [ clears throat ] so that ' s the way it ' s done . 
i ' ve , uh , i ' ve been at dunder mifflin for 12 years , the last four as regional manager . if you want to come through here . . . see we have the entire floor . so this is my kingdom , as far as the eye can see . this is our receptionist , pam . pam ! pam - pam ! pam beesly . pam has been with us for . . . forever . right , pam ? 
if you think she ' s cute now , you should have seen her a couple of years ago . [ growls ] 
any messages ? 
oh ! pam , this is from corporate . how many times have i told you ? there ' s a special filing cabinet for things from corporate . 
it ' s called the wastepaper basket ! look at that ! look at that face . 
people say i am the best boss . they go , " god we ' ve never worked in a place like this before . you ' re hilarious . " " and you get the best out of us . " [ shows the camera his world ' s best boss mug ] i think that pretty much sums it up . i found it at spencer gifts . 
whassup ! 
whassup ! 
whass . . . up ! 
 [ strains , grunts ] what ? 
ok . all right . see you later . 
back to work . 
corporate really doesn ' t really interfere with me at all . jan levinson gould . [ walking out of his office ] jan , hello . i call her hillary rodham clinton . right ? not to her face , because . . . well , not because i ' m scared of her . because i ' m not . but , um . . . yeah . 
um . . . me no get an agenda . 
i didn ' t get any agenda . 
really ? i didn ' t . . . [ looks at pam ] did we get a fax this morning ? 
why isn ' t it in my hand ? a company runs on efficiency of communication , right ? so what ' s the problem , pam ? why didn ' t i get it ? 
yeah , that was a joke . that was a joke that was actually my brother ' s , and . . . it was supposed to be with bills and it doesn ' t work great with faxes . 
yeah , yeah . lovely . thank you . 
ok . . . 
no , no , no , no , this is good . this is good . this is fine . excellent . 
all the alarm bells are kind of going . . . ringie - dingie - ding ! 
ok . no problem . 
me no wanna hear that , jan . because downsizing is a bitch . it is a real bitch . and i wouldn ' t wish that on josh ' s men . i certainly wouldn ' t wish it on my men . or women , present company excluded . sorry . uh , is josh concerned about downsizing himself ? not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing ? 
question . how long do we have to . . . [ telephone rings ] oh uh , todd packer , terrific rep . do you mind if i take it ? 
packman . 
oh , that ' s not appropriate . 
uh , i don ' t know what you mean . 
oh , my god ! oh ! that ' s . . . horrifying . horrible . horrible person . 
no , absolutely . under this regime , it will not leave this office . [ zips his lips ] like that . 
am i going to tell them ? no , i am not going to tell them . i don ' t see the point of that . as a doctor , you would not tell a patient if they had cancer . 
hey . 
guilty ! guilty as charged ! 
howard , like moe howard . three stooges . 
watch this . this is moe . nyuck - nyuck - nyuck - nyuck - nyuck . mee ! [ hold hand up for a high five ] ah , right here . three stooges . oh , pam . it ' s a guy thing , pam . i ' m sort of a student of comedy . watch this . here we go . [ yelling in cod german ] i ' m hitler . adolf hitler . [ continues with cod german ] 
relax . everything ' s under control . uh , yeah . yeah . that ' s important . right . oh this is so important , i should run to answer it . [ imitating six - million dollar man sound effect ] 
come on . six - million dollar man ! steve austin ! actually , that would be a good salary for me , don ' t you think ? six million dollars ? memo to jan . i deserve a raise . 
i ' m sorry ? 
if you ' re unhappy with your compensation , maybe you should take it up with hr . ok . not today , ok ? pam , just be professional . [ sighs ] 
i think i ' m a role model here . i think i garner people ' s respect . [ imitating a pa ] attention all dunder mifflin employees , please . we have a meeting in the conference room , asap . 
people i respect , heroes of mine , would be bob hope . . . abraham lincoln , definitely . bono . and probably god would be the fourth one . and i just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it ' s really beyond words . it ' s really incalculable . 
now i know there ' s some rumors out there and i just kind of want to set the record straight . 
assistant to the regional manager . 
i ' m about to tell everybody . i ' m just about to tell everybody . 
you don ' t know what it is . [ laughs ] 
i don ' t need your permission . 
corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me . and jan is thinking about downsizing either the stamford branch or this branch . 
not gonna happen . 
it won ' t be out of my hands stanley , ok . i promise you that . 
no . 
well , yeah , it is a promise . and frankly , i ' m a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it . 
i know . hold on a second . i think pam wanted to say something . pam , you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then . 
well , pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings . 
no , stanley . no , you did not see me in there with her . i said if corporate wants to come in here and interfere , then they ' re gonna have to go through me . right ? you can go mess with josh ' s people , but i ' m the head of this family , and you ain ' t gonna be messing with my chillin . 
watch out for this guy . dwight schrute in the building . this is ryan , the new temp . 
introduce yourself . be polite . 
assistant to the regional manager . so , uh , dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything . 
that ' s his profit . 
ok . hold on , hold on . the judge is in session . what is the problem here ? 
what is that ? 
no , no , no . do not take it out . you have to eat it out of there , because there are starving people in the world [ turns to camera ] which i hate , and it is a waste of that kind of food . 
discipline . kinky ! [ laughs ] all right , here ' s the deal you guys . the thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop . 
and yeah , jim this is the time to stop putting dwight ' s personal effects into jell - o . 
 [ laughing ] nice . that ' s the way it is around here . it just kind of goes round and round . 
hey ! yes ! new guy ! he scores . 
pudding . pudding . . . i ' m trying to think of another dessert to do . 
so have you felt the vibe yet ? we work hard , we play hard . sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard . right ? i guess the atmosphere that i ' ve created here is that i ' m a friend first , and a boss second . . . and probably an entertainer third . [ knock at door ] just a second . right ? oh , hey do you like the jamie kennedy experiment ? punk ' d and all that kind of stuff ? 
you are gonna be my accomplice . just go along with it , ok ? 
just follow my lead . don ' t pimp me , all right ? come in . so , uh , corporate just said that i don ' t want to . . . 
oh , thank you . pam , can you come in here for a sec . just have a seat . i was gonna call you in anyway . you know ryan . as you know , there is going to be downsizing . and you have made my life so much easier in that i am going to have to let you go first . 
why ? well , theft and stealing . 
post - it notes . 
50 cents , yeah . if you steal a thousand post - it notes at 50 cents apiece , and you know , you ' ve made a profit . . . margin . you ' re gonna run us out of business , pam . 
yeah . i am . 
but the best thing about it is that we ' re not going to have to give you any severance pay . because that is gross misconduct and . . . just clean out your desk . i ' m sorry . 
 [ pam starts crying ] you been x ' d punk ! [ laughing ] surprise ! it ' s a joke . we were joking around . see ? ok . he was in on it . he was my accomplice . and it was kind of a morale booster thing . and we were showing the new guy around , giving him the feel of the place . so you . . . god , we totally got you . 
i don ' t know about that . 
what is the most important thing for a company ? is it the cash flow ? is it the inventory ? nuh - uh . it ' s the people . the people . my proudest moment here was not when i increased profits by 17 % or when i cut expenses without losing a single employee . no , no , no , no , no . it was a young guatemalan guy . first job in the country , barely spoke english . he came to me , and said , " mr . scott , would you be the godfather of my child ? " wow . wow . didn ' t work out in the end . we had to let him go . he sucked . 
 [ holding up a dundie and pretending it is talking ] hello . i ' m michael scott . i ' m the best boss in the world . 
pam ! pam - pam ! pam has been with us for . . . forever . right , pam ? 
yeah , at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on pam . 
messages ? 
ah , right here . three stooges . high five . [ michael and ryan high five ] oh , pam . it ' s a guy thing , pam . [ camera cuts to pam then back to michael ] now , who was the one before curly ? 
curly ? very good . curly joe derita . 
well , comedy ' s kinda my thing . watch this , here ' s curly joe . mmm . me , me , me , me , me , me . me , me , me , me , me , me . oh , i forgot . here we go . [ yelling in cod german ] i ' m hitler . right . [ continues with cod german ] me , me , me , me , me , me . curly joe hitler . [ laughs ] 
all these people are walking around and they ' re happy and their lives are just going along , ignorance is bliss . but if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster . [ imitating monster ] " i ' m gonna get you , downsizing . " no . they wouldn ' t . . . they ' d freak . and i ' m not going to play god . they look to me for support . and they look to me for guidance and leadership . and i think if i could lie to them and it serves them , then that ' s what i ' m going to do . 
so this is our sales staff . they are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money . [ comes to a screeching halt and laughs ] this is accounting . the numbers dudes . do not let the job description fool you , they are all completely crazy . especially that guy , he is a mental patient . [ camera zooms in on kevin ] not literally of course , that wouldn ' t work . the last place you ' d want somebody like that is accounting . [ hides behind office plant ] " very interesting , but stupid . " artie johnson . it ' s a crazy place . 
what you don ' t know . . . well , it can hurt you , but if you don ' t know it won ' t hurt you . then , you can just be happy for a little while at least . 
what ' s that ? 
oh , john belushi . what a crazy guy . phew , freaked myself out this morning . 
yeah . i thought i found a lump . i checked the , uh . . . i check the jewels every month . this time . . . you know , it ' s a little different . it was fine . it was fine . but freaky , man , you know . testicular cancer , god . cancer , whoa testicles . so . . . what ' s , um . . . what you eating ? 
oh , place around the corner . nice . all right . see you later . 
do i need to speak up ? [ grabs boom microphone ] hello . 
i think better to be a happy idiot then a , um . . . then someone who knows the truth . 
hey , uh , can i help you out in here ? 
gotcha . good . i ' d go with the rows . that ' s a good idea . 
today is diversity day and someone ' s going to come in and talk to us about diversity . it ' s something that i ' ve been pushing , that i ' ve been wanting to push , for a long time and corporate mandated it . and i never actually talked to corporate about it . they kind of beat me to the punch , the bastards . but i was going to . and i think it ' s very important that we have this . i ' m very , very excited . 
hey , oscar ! how are you doing , man ? 
did you have a good weekend going there ? 
oh yeah , i bet it was fun . [ to mr . brown ] oh , hey ! this is oscar - - - 
right . see ? i don ' t even know , first - name basis ! 
oh hey , well , diversity , everybody , let ' s do it . oscar works in . . . here . jim , could you wrap it up , please ? 
it ' s diversity day , jim . i wish every day was diversity day . 
come on people , let ' s get ' em in . get in the cards ! get in the cards ! 
you know what ? this is a color - free - zone here . stanley , i don ' t look at you as another race . 
exactly , were not . . . 
with tolerance . 
ignorance . 
let ' s celebrate . 
celebrate good times . come on ! let ' s celebrate diversity . right ? 
you know what ? here ' s what we ' re going to do . why don ' t we go around and everybody . . . everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually . i will go last . go . 
yes . 
ok . 
hey , hey why don ' t you run it by me and i ' ll run it by him . 
ok . why don ' t we just defer to mr . . . 
ah . oh , right ! ok . first test . i will not call you that . 
how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground - breaking and then i go and do the exact same routine , same comedic timing , and people file a complaint to corporate ? is it because i ' m white and chris is black ? 
i will play the chris rock guy . i would like to see someone else pull this off . 
ok , i will play guy listening . 
ok . 
kevin is a great guy . he ' s a great accountant . he is not much of an entertainer . 
ok . i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry . he ' s ruin . . . he ' s butchering it . could you just let me . . . [ as chris rock ] every time . . . every time black people want to have a good time , some ignant ass . . . [ bleep ] i take care of my kid ! 
 [ bleep ] they always want credit for something they supposed to do ! 
 [ as chris rock ] what you want a cookie ? 
 [ clears throat ] i don ' t think i can sign this . 
well , ok , it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already , so . . . i know , i could sign something that says that i taught something , or that i helped you teach something , so . . . pam ! where is she ? pam , could we change something on this ? 
sure . 
here ' s the thing . this office , i think this is very advanced in terms of . . . racial awareness and it ' s probably more advanced than you ' re used to . that ' s probably throwing you off a little bit . 
ok , well i know . you told me that several times . 
ok . 
well , here i am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training . and you don ' t . 
i won ' t . 
yeah , yeah . 
 " i regret my actions . i regret offending my coworkers . i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty , empathy , respect and open - mindedness . . . " open - mindedness , is that even a word ? " . . . into the workplace . in this way , i can truly be a hero . signed , daffy duck . " [ laughing ] he ' s going to lose it when he reads that . 
 " i pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart . " i do believe . . . in that part of the pledge i that just read . but a pledge ? come on . i mean who are we , the girl scouts ? no . look . . . the guy , " mr . brown , " he got us halfway there . he got us talking . well , no . i got us talking . he got us nothing . he insulted us and he abandoned us . you call that diversity training ? i don ' t . were there any connections between any of us ? did anyone look each other in the eye ? was there any emotion going on ? no . where was the heart ? i didn ' t see any heart . where was my oprah moment ? ok , get as much done as you can before lunch because , afterward , i ' m going to have you all in tears . 
all right ? everybody pretty ? come on . here we go . it ' s time . let ' s do some good . 
get out . 
no , this is not a joke . ok ? that was offensive and lame . so double offensive . this is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here . ok , let ' s go . let ' s do it . come on . let ' s have some fun , everybody . here we go . take a seat . cop a squat . and um . . . thanks for coming in . um . . . diversity . . . is the cornerstone of progress as i ' ve always said . but don ' t take my word for it . let ' s take a look at the tape . 
 [ on the tape ] hi . i ' m michael scott . i ' m in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton , pennsylvania but i ' m also the founder of diversity tomorrow , because today is almost over . abraham lincoln once said that , " if you ' re a racist , i will attack you with the north . " and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace . 
ok . questions ? comments ? anybody ? jim ? 
yes . i only had an hour to put it together but i ' m going to add on to it later on . 
uh , yes . that probably had something to do with the camera work . anybody else ? um . . . 
yeah , well , if you leave we ' ll only have two left . yes . enjoy . absolutely . namaste . ok , well since i am leading this , let ' s get down to business and why don ' t i just kind of introduce myself , ok ? um . i am michael and i am part english , irish , german and scottish . sort of a virtual united nations . but what some of you might not know is that i am also part native american indian . 
two fifteenths . 
well , you know what , it ' s kind of hard for me to talk about it . their suffering . so who else ? let ' s get this popping . come on . who ' s going ? who ' s going ? let ' s go here . oscar , right here . you ' re on . 
oh , yeah . . . 
wow . 
wow . that is . . . that is a great story . that ' s the american dream right there , right ? 
um , let me ask you , is there a term besides mexican that you prefer ? something less offensive ? 
well , it has certain connotations . 
like . . . i don ' t . . . i don ' t know . 
no . now , remember that honesty . . . 
 . . . empathy , respect . . . [ phone ringing ] jim ! jim ! 
i have something here . i want you to take a card . put it on your fore . . . don ' t look at the card . i want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and . . . take a card , take a card , any card . um . . . and i want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead . ok ? so everybody has a different race . nobody knows what their race is , so . . . i want you to really go for it , cause this is real . you know , this isn ' t just an exercise . this is real life . and . . . i have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly . get ' er done . 
why ? because martin luther king is a hero of mine . there ' s this great chris rock bit about how streets named after martin luther king tend to be more violent . i ' m not going to do it but it ' s . . . 
oh this is a good one . 
push it . 
good . bom bom bom - bom bom . come on olympics of suffering right here . slavery versus the holocaust . come on . 
no , that was inadvertent . we didn ' t actually plan that . 
pam , come on . " i like your food . " come on stir the pot . stir the melting pot , pam ! let ' s do it . let ' s get ugly . let ' s get real . 
you ' ll notice i didn ' t have anybody be an arab . i thought that would be too explosive . no pun intended . but i just though . " too soon for arabs . " maybe next year . um . . . you know , the ball ' s in their court . 
ok . all right . no . it ' s good . you just need to push it . you need to go a little bit further . all right . ok . 
 [ voice raised , indian accent ] kelly , how are you ? 
oh ! welcome to my convenience store . would you like some googi googi ? i have some very delicious googi , googi , only 99 cents plus tax . try my googi , googi . [ lowering voice ] try my googi , googi . [ high - pitched voice ] try my googi , googi . try my . . . [ slap ! ] 
 [ trying not to cry ] all right ! all right ! yes ! that was great , she gets it ! now she knows what it ' s like to be a minority . 
i just hated it when that guy was in here . mr . brown , if that was his real name . i mean , he had never met any of us before , and here he was telling us how to do our thing . i just wanted . . . i just wanted to do it our way . you know ? on our own . man i should have gotten some food . 
okay , kevin . you can take that off that thing , ok ? that would really , really have shown him up , wouldn ' t it ? if i ' d brought in some burritos or some colored greens . or some pad thai . i love pad thai . 
what ? 
that doesn ' t really make sense . because you don ' t call them collared people , that ' s offensive . hmmm . . . ok , well , it ' s after five . so . . . thank you very much . buena vista oscar . thank you . good job . oh , my man . thank you brazil . nice . 
yeah . i would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour . 
no , the country . 
yeah , more like a 1 , 000 . 
i just think that hero ? it ' s cute , but it ' s . . . it ' s empty , you know ? it ' s easy . dwight , you know what , i came up with some terms of my own . could you put these on the board ? the first one is inclusion , new attitudes , color - blind . . . 
expectations . . . . 
thank you . sharing . . . 
and tolerance . 
well , it ' s not ideal but you have to give me some credit ' cause i made it into a word . 
i will give you a number of reasons why it is , actually . okay , first , incest is bad . racism is bad . no brainer , right ? two , incest . we ' re all a family , right ? we ' re all brothers and sisters . racial message ? um ? number three , and this is a fact . the states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest . okay ? and finally . . . 
no , no , no , no , wait . final one , final one this is important . the more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest , literally . 
okay . i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry this guy ' s a temp and i should ' ve told you that . 
yeah , but no , seriously . uh , you know , he ' s not a member of the full staff so , uh , ryan you wanna just step outside ? 
well , maybe you should go down to the parking lot . you know what . yes , go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots . cool ? ' cause the handicaps get a raw deal . oh , you know what . that ties right into new attitudes . new attitudes about handicap people . very important . 
 " in this way , i can truly be a hero . signed , daffy duck . " [ laughing ] he ' s going to lose it when he reads that . doh ! hogan ! not again , hogan ! get col . burkhalter on the phone ! [ laughing ] i ' m kind of a hogan around here . and kind of , jan is kind of col . burkhalter , then dwight is schultz . but , it ' s . . . oh , god . we have fun . we have fun . ' cause he ' s gonna be pissed . [ making voice ] no doubt about it . 
are we going ? [ dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown ] don ' t do that . just say action when we ' re ready . 
 [ mumbling ] should i . . . turn , no . do it again . 
hi . i ' m michael scott . i ' m in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton , pennsylvania but i ' m also the founder of diversity tomorrow , because today is almost over . abraham lincoln once said that , " if you ' re a racist , i will attack you with the north . " and those are the principles . . . damn it . okay , sorry . don ' t laugh ; please don ' t laugh this time dwight . you ' re . . . it ' s , it ' s bugging me . let me give myself a countdown , ready ? three , two , one .

could i count myself down please , dwight . three , two , one . hi . i ' m michael scott . i ' m in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton , pennsylvania but i ' m also the founder of diversity tomorrow , because today is almost over . abraham lincoln once said that , " if you ' re a racist , i will attack you with the north . " and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace . 
 [ wandering around the room during his diversity exercise ] i want you to push it . i want you to push ' cause breakthroughs are right around the corner . something ' s going to pop here . something ' s going to pop between a party . feel what it ' s like to be in someone else ' s skin . what does it feel like to be a different race ? it feels pretty bad doesn ' t it . so let that come out . 
yeah , i marched on washington back in the day . i went to the washington monument and the lincoln memorial , u . s . mint , congressman talked to our class . it was pretty cool . 
talk like you ' re talking to that race . i have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile . so keep it going . [ camera shows devon sitting outside with west nile ]

ah , none . you ' re picking a health care plan . 
you can use the conference room as a temporary workspace . 
nope , you cannot use it . 
temporary workspace . you can use it . 
if dwight fails , then that is strike two , and good for me for , ah , for giving him a second chance . and if he succeeds , then , you know , no one will be prouder than i am . i groomed him . i made him what he is today . unless he fails , and we ' ve talked about that already .

i ' ve really learned from the greats . the great improvisers , drew carey , ryan stiles , uh , the brady guy not so much . he ' s more the signing , wayne brady . um , robin williams . oh , man , would i love to go head - to - head with him . oh ! that would be exciting . [ as robin williams ] " hi . i ' m mork from ork . " well , i ' m bork from spork . nanoo , nanoo . jibelee , baloobaloo . [ as robin williams ] " that ' s good morning , vietnam ! " well , hello to you . you know it would be . . . god . and you know what , sometimes when i ' m watching somebody like um , like jay leno . he ' ll be half way through his step [ snaps his fingers ] and i will already be laughing at the punch line . he hasn ' t even gotten to it . he doesn ' t even know what it is it . so it ' s fun , you know it ' s fun having a mind that works like that . that is just a few steps ahead of . . . comedically ahead of like what ' s going on . like i ' ll watch t . v . and i ' ll be watching a show and i will think , oh , i know someone ' s gonna walk in here right now and say something funny . and then they do . or , um , i know they ' ll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down . there ' s going to be some sort of insult . and there is . you know , there ' s like , " oh you ' re . . . god your butt is fat . " and i knew it . i know it ' s like i knew they were going to say that . i knew they were gonna go there . don ' t go there . um , but other . . . you know it ' s like uh , you know leno , um and letterman , carson , you know . need i say more ? no .

there ' s no downsizing . 
assistant to the regional manager dwight . 
look , look , look . i talked to corporate , about protecting the sales staff . and they said they couldn ' t guarantee it if there ' s downsizing , okay ? 
but there ' s no downsizing , so just don ' t . . . 
mmm , mm , mm . maybe . 
it looks like there ' s gonna be downsizing . and it ' s part of my job , but . . . blah ! i hate it . i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that , uh , i get no pleasure out of saying the words , " you ' re fired . " [ as donald trump ] " you ' re foir - ed . uh , you ' re foir - ed . " it just makes people sad , and an office can ' t function that way . no way . [ as donald trump ] " you ' re foir - ed . " i think if i had a catchphrase it would be , " you ' re hired , and you can work here as long as you want . " but that ' s unrealistic , so . . . 
get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott . now , i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam . . . smile , pam . i have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up , so we can have a little celebration for it . not bad , not bad at all . all right . and the birthday person is . . . drum roll please . here we go , who is the birthday , birthday person ?

 [ misses a free throw badly ] i . . . i think you can play . like you could when you were a kid . i think you can never give up the play . because if people stop playing , then they stop living . it ' s like a shark . if a shark stops playing he stops living . and sharks are very playful creatures . 
you know what . i think most basketball movies are great movies . because it ' s a great subject . there ' s one about a little kid who , um , joins a professional basketball team and he ' s really , really good and he can dunk and he ' s like 3 feet tall . and he can dunk the ball . that , oh , i love that movie . that movie kind of , that movie makes me cry . i don ' t like to cry on camera , but that movie makes me cry . um , because it touches a cord in me about hoops . [ michael ' s free throw is really short ] short , short , short ! and basketball is like jazz , you know . to like pertipify it there ' s a jazz musician , a guy , you know . . . if you know jazz you know who i mean . he ' s uh , god what was his name ? um , he plays one of those curly horns , like those really shiny curly horns that ' s used in jazz a lot .

this is my conference room . so please , uh , make yourself at home . whatever you need , i ' m right on the other side of this wall . [ knocks on wall ] used to be a window here . there ' s not anymore . so , that ' s where i will be . 
so if you need anything else , something to make you more confortable just don ' t hesitate to ask . i ' m right here . 
wait a second . i should have spotted another addict . uh , gotta love the ' bucks . 
it ' s like a slang for starbucks . they ' re all over the place . oh , man , that place is like the promised land to me . what a business model too . ah , too bad we don ' t have the good stuff here . 
nah , it ' s not . it ' s spppplllibbb 
no , here ' s the thing . y ' know i do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me , and they ' re always putting up walls and i ' m always tearing ' em down , just breakin ' down barriers , that ' s what i do all day . so a coffee , regular coffee for you . high test , or unleaded ?

not it ' s not , there ' s some in the straw . [ michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck ] there , now you may throw it out . 
that ' s over several months , ryan . 
i think in order to be a ladies man , it ' s imperative that people don ' t know you ' re a ladies man , so i kind of play that close to the chest . i don ' t know , what can i say ? women are attracted to power . and i think other people have told me that i have a very symmetrical face . [ laughs ] i don ' t know . i don ' t know . maybe they ' re right ? i don ' t know . 
sure you don ' t want me to help you with that ? cause i can grab that no problem . 
see you later . goodnight . goodnight , jim . 
where you going ? 
with us ? 
okay . great . off the hook . excellent . okay , cool . 
alright , have fun . 
don ' t drink and drive . 
take it easy .

do i have a special someone ? uh well , yeah of course . a bunch of ' em . my employees . if i had to choose between a one - night - stand with some stupid cow i pick - up in a bar , and these people ? i ' d pick them every time . because with them , it is an everyday stand and i still know their names in the morning . 
dwight . dwight . dwight ! okay , that ' s it . keep it in your pants .

thank you , al gore . . . for the internet . can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye . can you believe we couldn ' t do that ten years ago ?

 [ talking over toby and katy ] toby ' s divorced . god , that ' s hard . that really ripped you up . she got the kids right ? that ' ll damage ya . sorry man . that ' s uh , that ' s a bad one . how much you paying her ? what can , you can ' t even afford anything now , right ? you ' re all right though , right ? don ' t ask me for a raise . [ laughs ] cup of soup ' s a good idea though . that ' ll . . . that ' s a good budgetary thing to do .

all right . this is gonna be good . 
tonight is the dundies , the annual employee awards night here at dunder mifflin .

" and the neighbor will say , " no man . i mean , i slave all day and nobody notices me . " next thing you know , employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor ' s house . neighbor ' s hanged himself due to lack of recognition . so . . .

[ tears open envelope and pulls out card ] " name three businesses that have a better health care plans than dunder mifflin .

" that was , like , a long , long time ago . it ' s funny how the shelf life of these things , like how long they last , like , " too much information " probably came on the scene . . . i mean , i didn ' t hear it till , like , this month , so it ' s pretty recently . um , but you know , they ' re generally good for , like , no more than five or six years . 
all right , we need something for kevin .

 [ talking over jim ] he ' s fat . the fat accountant award .

why do you think that ? you just immediately go to that , dwight ? why are you so negative ? why . . . 
i mean , you just come in and you ' re just negative . . . 
 . . . and you just walk negatively . 
do you want me to find out what it says ? 
yes . 
what does that even mean ? what are you . . . what are you talking about ? 
just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me . but don ' t tell anybody that i have anything to do with it because if they ask me , i will say that you are crazy . 
thank you . you won ' t regret this , michael . 
i hadn ' t planned on including him . 
kevin . 
well , what should i do , guys ? seriously , do you want me to just cancel the dundies ? 
ping ? everybody loves ping . he ' s my most popular character . 
really ? well , he is based on the chinese delivery guy that i have , who talks exactly like that , so , i think you should take it up with him instead of me . 
 [ sighs ] well , neither of you are chinese , so what . . . why do you care ? 
what ? 
dwight , you ' ve hit a new low here . 
that is a good point . 
okay , all right , i will do that . i will get to that definitely . absolutely . 
oh , i don ' t know . maybe after i finish writing , producing , directing , and hosting your awards show . all right , just relax , keep your pants on . unless , of course , you ' re in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without creepsville central spying on you . good .

he ' s hot , all right ? what do you want me to do about it ? 
 [ sighing ] it was unanimous , toby . 
well , okay , i based it on what i felt was unanimous office sentiment , and this isn ' t even about what ryan thinks . it ' s about you . it ' s about how you feel about the dundies . admit it . 
yes , it is true . 
okay , i don ' t have time for this . i need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration . [ imitating native chant ] me chief michael scott . here to trade . . . 
don ' t wanna forget that . 
absolutely . is this mine or is this chili ' s ?

kay . 
i am king of forwards . it ' s how i like to do business , everybody joking around . we ' re like ' friends ' . i am chandler and joey and , uh , pam is rachel . and dwight is kramer . 
that ' s funny ! that ' s funny . not offensive . uh . . . because it ' s nature . educational . 
um , i . . . 
yeah . . . maybe . maybe . well , we ' ll see . because i . . . i don ' t know if it ' s . . . [ muffled by jacket over his head ] whup ! come on ! hey ! 
kay ! oh , you are so bad ! yeah ! 
oh , boom ! bam ! oh , this guy is out of control ! he is a madman ! better get the bleep button ready for him . 
uh oh . 
uh oh ! oh - ho - ho - ho - ho - o ! 
todd packer and i are total bff . best friends forever . he and i came up together as salesmen . one time , we were out and we met this set of twins . and packer told them that we were brothers . and so , you know , one thing led to another , and we brought em back to the motel . and then packer did both of them . it was awesome . so . . . 
oh - whoa - oh ! oh ! okay . grade ' a ' gossip for you , right now . randall , cfo , resigned . nobody knows why . 
really ? here we go ! buckle up . it ' s going to be a bumpy one ! 
oh , yeah . 
well , to be fair . . . blondes , brunettes , you know , there ' s a lot of dumb people out there . 
oh ! wow ! i didn ' t say it ! i didn ' t say it ! 
oh , wow ! what did i tell you about the bleep button . 
oh . bad boy . [ to ryan ] um . . . ryan ? [ makes donald duck noise ] 
ah ! man . that todd packer can do anything . 
hey , send me that link to the monkey sex video . i ' m going to forward it like it ' s hot . 
forward it like it ' s hot . forward it like it ' s hot . " old school " . 
yes , toby ? 
um . . . literally two seconds ? 
toby is in hr which technically means he works for corporate . so he ' s really not a part of our family . also he ' s divorced so he ' s really not a part of his family . 
no , no , toby . no . 
it is a big deal . it ' s a big deal ! what are we supposed to do ? scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day ? i mean , come on ! 
what ? 
no ! 
what ? he ! no ! okay , what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us ? to not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes ? 
there is no such thing as an appropriate joke . that ' s why it ' s a joke . 
everyone ! hello ! everyone . hi ! sorry to interrupt . i know you ' re all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption . but toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day . [ to toby ] so , take it away . 
i wish you luck , toby . i really do . but you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and i just can ' t wait to see how you handle it . 
a guy goes to a five dollar . . . lady of the night and he gets crabs . so , the next day he goes back to complain . and the woman says " hey . it was only five dollars . what did you expect ? lobster ? " this is what ' s at stake . 
time to bring out the big guns . i ' m heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born . find a killer joke that ' ll just blow everybody away at the seminar later . and remind them what is great about this place . so . . . ah ! here they are . [ to warehouse guys ] guys ! wondering if i could , uh , get your help for something . i ' m looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer . and it does not need to be clean . so whatcha got ? 
um , yeah , no , well . . . i mean better . better than that . the type of stuff you guys tell all day . 
alright , alright . well , yeah , but , you know . . . a joke but not necessarily at my expense . 
oooh , okay . that was still about me . 
what ? 
i don ' t feel bad . 
no , i don ' t . 
okay . 
well , not exactly what i was looking for but thanks guys . 
thank you . 
hi , is it over ? 
no . 
i know , i know . it ' s good . it is not over . it is not over til it ' s over . 
did he tell you everything ? obviously , he didn ' t because you all still look relatively happy . albeit bored . do you realize what we ' re losing ? seriously ? 
exactly ! mmwwah [ blows kiss to angela ] ! can we afford to lose email forwards ? do we want that ? 
give me a break . umm . . . stanley , how about that hot picture you have by your desk ? centerfold in the catholic schoolgirl ' s outfit ? i mean , it is hot , it is sexy , and it turns him on . and i will admit , best part of my morning is staring at it . but what ? are we just going to take it away ? 
i think the old honor system was just fine . for example , i have never slept with an employee . and , believe me , i could have . 
no ! no ! catherine . remember her ? remember how hot she was ? 
she would have definitely slept with me . 
yes , she was . dammit , kevin ! 
what if pam was a lesbian ? what if she brought her " partner " in to work ? [ to toby ] would that be crossing the line ? 
what if they made out ? in front of everybody ? 
at home ? and i told everybody everything about it . 
okay . well , then let ' s act it out . pam , you will be girl a and girl b will be . . . okay ! we ' ll use the doll . pam . pam ? 
i wish todd packer was here because he would love this . i wonder if anybody else would like to do this . hey ! um . . . we have to watch , uh , toby ' s video that he ' s showing us in order to brainwash us and i was wondering if anybody would like to join in ? going to be fun . got my great pizza . whataya say ? jim ? 
that ' s what she said . pam ? 
that ' s what she sai [ clears throat ] nope , but . . . okay . well , suit yourself . 
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . . . okay ! hypocrite ! she is a hypocrite . that is such a scam ! okay . 
okay , you are never going to believe this . the girl in the video we ' re watching that corporate gave us . . . darryl banged her ! aaand is about 90 % sure . 
so you are the lawyer , mr . o ' malley ? i know a lot of lawyer jokes . 
well , it ' s probably because you don ' t get ' em . 
when i said before that i was king of forwards , you got to understand that i don ' t come up with this stuff . i just forward it along . you wouldn ' t arrest a guy who ' s just delivering drugs from one guy to another . 
the problem is that i am the boss and apparently i can ' t say anything . 
where ' s the line ? where ' s the line , jan . 
no , i ' ve seen the video . 
no , i didn ' t . [ to jan ] huh , what ? [ everyone looks up at blow - up doll ] 
attention , everyone ! hello ! ah , yes ! i just want you to know that , uh , this is not my decision , but from here on out . . . we can no longer be friends . and when we talk about things here we must only discuss work - associated things . and , uh , you can consider this my retirement from comedy . and in the future , if i want to say something funny or witty or do an impression , i will no longer , ever , do any of those things . 
mmmhmm . yes . 
that ' s what she said ! 
 [ laughing ] come on . 
mwah ! [ kisses hand and salutes office ] 
you would have done the same . you just didn ' t think of it first . 
it ' s . . . that ' s . . . 
okay . [ to man entering office ] hello . [ introduces ] jan . mr . o ' malley . this is my lawyer , james p . albiny . 
i believe you may recognize his face from the billboards . he specializes in free speech issues . 
this guy does it all . 
what ? 
so i ' m not in trouble ? 
i am so used to being the bad boy . i am so used to fighting corporate that i forget that i am corporate . upper management . they hooked me up with an attorney . to protect me . you can ' t be too careful about what you say . mo ' money , mo ' problems . 
okay . well , let ' s get you out of here , james . um . . . i think we ' re under an hour still , so . . . 
i know . we ' ll talk about it later . thanks for coming in . 
no . no , no , no . that crosses the line . 
not you . kevin . just unwarranted . hostile work environment , kevin . 
no . you said it . he pointed . a point is not a say . look . kevin , we are a family here and phyllis is a valued member of that family . like a grandmother . 
i don ' t know about that . 
well , i have a late birthday and usually september ' s a cut - off point . [ to kevin ] you know what ? you just crossed the line . okay ? there ' s a line and you went over it . and you must be punished . so go to your corner . 
yes , your corner . go . 
mmmhmmm . 
they didn ' t get to me . i got to them . i am still the same old michael scott . new and improved . you know what ? i love phyllis . you know what else ? i think she is gorgeous . i think she is incredibly , incredibly attractive person . [ to phyllis ] c ' mere , c ' mere , c ' mon ! come on ! come on . 
oooh ! 
i ' m not worried . 
you know what ? the only thing i ' m worried about . . . is getting a boner . good work today , everybody . 
times have changed a little . and even though we ' re still a family here at dunder - mifflin , families grow . and at some point , the daddy can ' t take a bath with the kids anymore . i am upper management . and it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with pam . as much as i might want to . 
good morning , pam . 
what ' s going on ? 
what ? 
i don ' t get what you mean . 
well , you said i looked thin , so what does . . . does that mean i ' m like thin weird or thin handsome or . . . [ laughing ] 
yes , well , of course . of course . [ laughing ] 
office romance . for example , pam and i are dating , do we have to disclose that ? 
no , but i ' m saying hypothetically if we were dating . . . 
well , roy is dead , and i ask you out . 
you say yes , and we go out . 
and now roy and pam are dead , and we have your stupid rules to blame , toby . 
toby actually gets alimony from his ex - wife because she makes more , so that ' s kind of embarrassing . not that i ' d mind , but it would never happen to me because i would make the marriage work . people seem to like him because they think he ' s one of us , but he ' s not . he ' s this weird loner who just tells people , " don ' t do this , don ' t do that . hire this person for this reason . " i would complain about him , but who would i go to , to complain about toby ? toby . bias . and what does he do about that ? nothing . because he ' s toby . what kind of name is that ? it ' s almost a girl ' s name . i think i ' ve known more girls named toby than guys . he just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit . toby is the devil . toby ' s the devil . 
i ' m an early bird , and i ' m a night owl . so i ' m wise , and i have worms . oh , breakfast . 
yummy , yummy . thank you , ryan . 
um . the sausage , egg , and cheese biscuit . but thank you . and why don ' t you take a couple hours . the office is yours . " home alone , " " risky business . " take your pants off , run around . whatever you gotta do . 
ok . [ removes biscuit , leaving only sausage , egg and cheese . ] healthier . gotta watch those carbs . 
today , i , michael scott , am becoming a homeowner . investing in real estate . 
yes it is . yes it is . it is very important to own property . back in olden days , they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they ' d throw you in the stocks and humiliate you . 
maybe . 
yes . yes . final walkthrough . 
sign the papers at the condo . 
uh , i don ' t need one . 
i don ' t need a representative . 
no , no . 
no . dwight . i ' m fine . 
well , this isn ' t about work . this is closing on a condo , it ' s completely personal . 
except that , this is about my living arrangement , and as boss , i need to have a living arrangement in order to do work . 
ok . fine . yes , you can come . 
as my associate . 
no it is not . 
oh , most honorable pamera . not offensive , because that ' s the way they talk in movies . 
we are . dwight and i are going to the big thing . so why don ' t you have everybody work on their expense reports and i ' d like them in by the end of the day . 
very good . 
we will . um , did you do the thing i asked you to do about the magazines ? 
good . the small business man ? 
maxim ? american way ? cracked ? 
how about , uh , fine arts ? aficionado monthly ? 
no , well can you get on that , because i don ' t just read cracked . thank you . 
ok . see you soon . 
i don ' t know , regular . normal ones . nothing fancy . not my style . what are you doing ? 
what ? no , dwight . it ' s fifty degrees outside . don ' t . . . please . . . 
i . . . just . . . would you put it up ? [ roof opens ] ok . fine . just leave it down . whiner . 
i do not understand what you spend your money on . 
home , sweet home . 
right there . my sanctuary . my party pad . someday i can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here . hang a swing from this tree . push them back . . . wait . . . [ turns around ] no , it ' s this one , right here . home , sweet home . 
oh , how are you ? nice to meet you , bill . bill . mr . bill . ohhh nooo . mr . bill . ohhh ! snl ? when they pull him apart ? he ' d always get rolled over by something . 
nice to meet you too . 
yeah , small . i ' m buying it and i ' m not renting it . so , it ' s still an upgrade . he doesn ' t know anything about property ownership . kind of an idiot . um . 
oh . good . that ' s good . it ' s good to be accommodating of that . 
this , my friends , is the master bedroom . check out the cathedral ceilings . those are like seventeen feet high . we have cable readiness . [ points at wall ] right there . i am going to totally pimp this place out . i am going to put a surround sound system . i am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall . 
i ' m putting my bed right over here . 
well , then i will get a warrantee . 
well then i won ' t get a warrantee . 
so that ' s the problem , is solved . what ? 
uh . . . ten year . 
what ? wha ? you said ten . 
ok , ok , ok . 
alright . 
ok . alright . oh boy . 
um . oh . [ moves stove burner ] oh , ok . is that suppose to come off ? 
um . i ' m going to take a little breather for a second . excuse me . 
oh , man . 
uh . [ breathes deeply , head at knees ] 
the ceilings are lower than they were last week . that , i don ' t . . . i don ' t . . . 
 . . . know if you showed me this same unit or not . 
where are all the hot people ? i was told that there would be all these attractive singles . 
as far as i can tell , i ' m the best - looking person here . 
there ' s a basic principle in real estate , that you should never be the best - looking person in the development . it ' s just sorta common sense , because if you are , then you ' ve no place to go but down . 
no , no , no . 
i am not going to rent the third bedroom . i want a price reduction or i am a - walkin . 
ehhhh . . . . 
i made the right decision . i ' m glad i signed . i ' m a homeowner . right ? good to be a homeowner . diversifying . this is good . this is fun . we ' re having fun . 
there ' s something else dwight wanted to talk to you about . i have a surprise for you , for helping me out today . 
no , no . i insist . i insist . because you ' ve really done some great work . great work . and that is why , i am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent . 
why did i do it ? because i believe in rewarding people for their efforts . ah . i rewarded dwight with the room , and he is rewarding me back , ah , with $ 500 plus utilities . 
i ' m thinking , lock into a four year commitment , we ' ll go month to month after that . or , until i start dating , have a girlfriend , then you ' re , you know , you ' re gone . 
what the hell is a terrarium ? 
oh , so an aquarium . ah , that will not come into this place . 
we take separate cars . 
why would we do that ? 
no . 
ehhhhnt . game over . offer revoked . dwight . i ' m sorry , but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy , and help out a friend , and this is what happens . this is what i get . oh god . i ' m . . . ok . 
yeah , well , you know what ? nobody cares about your stupid beet farm . beets are the worst . 
nobody likes beets . 
nobody likes beets , dwight . why don ' t you grow something that everybody does like ? you should grow candy . i ' d love a piece of candy right now . not a beet . 
stop it ! [ smacks dwight ' s arm ] 
yeah . jim . slim jim . what ' s going . . . what ' s going on ? 
oh . thanks . thanks . it ' s very cool . it ' s a three bedroom , gay - friendly . 
you know . 
really ? 
what ' s this ? 
i don ' t really know what to say . um , i ' m not one for making speeches , but ah , my heart is very full at this moment . 
get up here , dwight . 
yep , not as good as gold . [ national anthem plays ] why are you playing the national anthem ? 
oh . [ doves move across cord ] what the hell is that ? 
oh , okay . i ' ll tell you . let ' s see here . three bedroom , two bath . . . 
 . . . contemporary townhouse . two car parking . . . 
 . . . wall - to - wall carpets . . . 
 . . . all fixtures included . yes , this is . . . this is looking good . 
i think it does . 
yes . 
i think it has a . . . yeah , it has a deck . they call it a porch , but it has a deck . 
when a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind . was i well - loved ? check . did i express myself ? did i let my light shine through ? check . will an attractive woman cry at my funeral ? check . probably more than one . check . check , check , check , check . lastly , did i achieve success and own real estate ? and when i close on this condo , i will be able to check that one as well . 
home owner . about to join an exclusive club , dwight . maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like . maybe not . who knows ? not my problem . [ groans ] 
are we ready ? 
are we gonna do it ? 
this is all mine . all the way down around the corner . it ' s a shared space , but i can use it whenever i want to , 
ah , the volunteer sheriff station . 
no . 
oh , anything bad ? 
mmm - hmm . 
mmm - hmm . 
no . 
i don ' t need a gun . 
hello ! how are you ? i ' m , uh , just about to close on 126 over there and i guess we ' re going to be neighbors . very cool , very cool . so , uh , so what ' s the vibe ? what ' s the vibe of this place ? 
oh . . . that ' s gonna change . [ laughing ] 
because i loves to party and i ' m gonna be partying my butt out at this place . 
here ' s a question for you . i have a convertible . is it safe that park that in my driveway . [ man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door ] all right . see you soon . good guy . um , cool . 
i think i ' m going to make myself some microwave popcorn . [ humming ] press " popcorn . " oh , that ' s gonna be delicious . i just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon . you know what ? i could do with some hot chocolate as well . oh , drat . i can ' t make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time , unless , i can . boom ! second microwave for le hot chocolat . 
oh , carol . hello , how are you ? 
good to see you . 
second bedroom for the ladies . i mean , the extra ladies who aren ' t in my bed , or for friends or family , whoever wants to pop on by to casa de scott . and right in here . . . what , what ' s in here ? uh - oh , bedroom number three . what are we gonna do in there ? limitless possibilities . 
what ? [ toilet flushing ] what are you doing in there ? 
oh , my god . dwight . 
you know what i might do , i might make this into a kids ' room . 
i will have a girlfriend once she sees this place . i ' m gonna get married and i ' m gonna have kids . 
i ' m not gonna date a 55 - year - old woman . 
no , it ' s not . just shut up . 
you ' re an ass . shut it . 
no , you don ' t . 
i ' m gonna back out of the deal . nothing personal , but i feel like i have been taken advantage of here . 
this smells of fraud to me . this whole thing just kind of stinks . 
howard , slash ryan , ryan howard is sitting in my office . and he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he ' s kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit . had a few laughs along the way . and now he wants to know what i think . 
shall we ? let us proceed . first up , proficiency in necessary skills . aaaaeeexcellent ! [ laughs ] 
five years from now , what do you want to do ? where do you want to be ? 
oh ! good . ambitious . excellent . want to be a manager ? 
that is ridiculous . 
ryan ' s about to attend the michael scott school of business . i ' m like mr . miyagi and yoda rolled into one . 
 [ speaks in a yoda voice ] much advice you seek . [ regular voice ] do you know who that is ? 
mmm . . . no . that was yoda . 
there are ten rules of business that you need to learn . number one : you need to play to win . but . . . you also have to win to play . 
and i will give you the rest of the ten at lunch . 
 [ to ryan ] [ makes clicking noises like shooting a gun ] hey ! 
yes , i was the first one out . and , yes , i ' ve heard women and children first . but , we do not employ children . we are not a sweat shop . thankfully . and , uh , women are equal in the workplace by law . so , i let them out first , i have a lawsuit on my hands . 
another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations . 
adapt . react . re - adapt . act . all right ? that ' s rule number two . 
so what was rule two ? 
okay , well , let ' s . . . . let ' s kind of take it a little slower . 
okay , uh , well , one is taken . 
well , he needs a permanent number , right ? 
um , yeah . okay . that . . . no , no , no . i got one . i got one . the three stooges . 
rule number four . in business , image is everything - andre agassi . this car is an investment . right ? if i have to take out a client or i ' m seen around scranton in it . i love it . i love this car . do you like it ? 
wow , some pretty big books back there , huh ?

uh . . . 
when i was ryan ' s age , i worked in a fast food restaurant , to save up money for school . and then i spe . . . lost it in a pyramid scheme . but i learned more about business , right then and there , than business school would ever teach me , or ryan would ever teach me . 
 [ to dwight ] shut , it . can i . . . can i just do it please ? [ to ryan ] uh , it ' s equal . 
okay . yes ! it was a trick question . 
okay , dwight . 
you know what , dwight ? you don ' t need to help me here . okay ? well , you know . . . maybe you should go to business school like ryan , then . . . then you ' d know what you ' re talking about . 
for instance , why don ' t you go to business . . . 
stop . dwight . you know what ? you ' re acting like a dork . would you cool it ? please . okay . hey ! he ' s not your five year old brother , dwight . he ' s a valued member of this company . . . and you know what ? he knows more about business than you ever will . 
i did not go to business school . you know who else didn ' t go to business school ? lebron james , tracy mcgrady , kobe bryant . they went right from high school to the nba . so . . . so it ' s not the same thing . at all . 
look at this stuff . market fragments . what is that supposed to be ? 
you are so smart . you are so eff - in ' smart . you should be teaching me . 
i became a salesman . . . because of people , i love making friends . but then i was promoted to manager , at a very young age . i still try to be a friend first , but . . . you know ? i ' m very successful . . . your coworkers look at you differently . huu , what do you think ? 
nah , i ' m okay . 
oh , hey . game , what game are we playing here ?

who ' s , uh . . . who ' s next ? who we got ? whooo . . . 
wish i had my cell phone , but i left it inside . so . . . 
what ' s that ? 
yeah . 
dwight . hey ! 
dwight , don ' t ! he is an idiot . the man is an idiot , ladies and gentlemen . 
i didn ' t say it to him . i said it about him . 
 [ in the background ] how long does it take to find a cell phone ? i don ' t know either . 
seriously , where the hell is dwight ? hey , call my cell phone . it ' ll make it easier for him to find . 
i gave it to you in the car .

dwight ! ? great goin ' . god , man ! why did you go in there ? what . . . everybody was scared out of their wits , man ? oooh .

hey , did you miss that day there , ryan ? 
toaster oven 101 ? 
hey ! i know what ' ll impress everybody , i ' ll start a fire . oh , man . bad idea . bad idea jeans . 
 [ singing ] . . . since the world was turning .

i ' ll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow . 
rule three : reach for the stars . and if you fail , see rule four . rule four : failure is not an option . 
yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . and at the end i will reveal , that they were all just one rule . 
mmm - hmm . 
no , i ' m not trying to trick him . i ' m trying to be a good mentor . so . . . 
no . 
no , come on , dwight , i have to have 10 of these by lunch , i promised ryan . 
i ' m not asking the temp for an extension unless i really need it . 
yes , yes , i ran out first . a captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship . and this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire . so , i ran out onto the ship . 
when i was ryan ' s age , i worked at arby ' s and then i worked selling cutlery for a while . cutlery that could decimate a penny , i kid you not . there were these shears that could cut straight through a penny . so i have life experience and work experience that ryan doesn ' t , and will never have . 
if i could change the life of one person , just one person . i . . . actually , that ' s shooting kind of low . i already did that when i was born . i changed two people ' s lives . mom and dad . um , if i could change the lives of 5 , 000 people . . . 10 , 000 . no , five . i ' d be satisfied with 5 , 000 . i . . . 10 , 000 though , that ' d be something . wow , 10 , 000 people . because , you know what ? even one is amazing . 
happy halloween , everyone ! [ notices pam , in her cat costume ] oh . . . that ' s great ! 
ohh . . . ok . 
i know why she ' s calling . it ' s the end of the month , and i was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month . and somehow i ' m supposed to put on a costume and smile . [ dials a number on his speaker phone ] okay . 
hey , sherri . michael scott returning . 
well , i ' m gonna wait till the end of the day . because the book said it ' s best to wait till the end of the day . 
i don ' t know . . . yet . i will have to call her back . 
okay . . . sherri ? 
if you were getting fired , how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you ? 
thanks . 
i ' ll call her back . [ talks softy , to himself ] wish i could fire sherri . 
okay ! i ' m sorry . 
no ? 
bye . 
i mean you hear about layoffs in the news , but when you actually have to do it yourself , it is heavy stuff . it ' s . . . these are people ' s lives you ' re talking about . 
yes . 
yes . 
yeeesh . 
um , pam , i have to let somebody go today . this is , uh , the hardest thing i ' ve ever had to do . 
because it ' s very scary stuff . 
you ' re worried about the party ? there ' s a man ' s life at stake here . 
no . or a woman . a human life . if you had to guess , who it would be based on their job performance . . . and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be ? 
and . . . sometimes you just let it go to voicemail . 
i know . i sent away for it in july from a catalog . [ bobs his head around , causing the costume head to jiggle around ] 
oh , man . okay , i have to fire somebody . 
hey . 
you guys excited about the party ? 
it ' s gonna be fun . 
 [ looks to oscar ] oh , boy . . . look at you ! haha . showing your colors . bet you wish you wore a dress every day . 
all good . happy halloween . what happened to all those spooky decorations that we had ? the cobwebs and such ? 
well , you know what ? go buy some more . i ' ll approve the overages . sound good ? 
good . oh , yeah , also about budget stuff . um , i ' m going to need you to find , like a , a full employee salary , plus benefits , like fifty grand . i ' m going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers . 
well , that ' s not what i ' m saying . just , you know , find it . pretend that your jobs depend on it . 
mmm - hm - hmm . interesting take on dorothy . i love it . hey , you know what would even be better ? soccer ball and cleats . 
 " bend it like beckham . " 
 [ laughs ] yeah . that would be perfect . 
well , i don ' t really have two heads . so . . . 
who do you think it should be ? 
no , jim brings in money . 
eh . 
it ' s not a popularity contest . although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale . 
 [ turns to the fake head , listening ] what ? there was someone left off that list ? who ? 
you ' re right , i didn ' t even think of him . 
yeah , that ' s actually a really good idea . 
yeah . . . i could . 
i ' m not saying that ' s what he said . 
 [ listening to his head ] what ? 
that is not a very nice thing to say about him . 
are you kidding ? 
i agree . he ' d land on his feet . 
so . how did it go with stanley ? how . . . how ' d he take it ? 
ahh , come on . 
i don ' t wanna fire stanley . i never said that . i ' m certainly not going to do it myself . get those big , baleful , eyes staring at me . yikes . just , okay , just . . . [ waves dwight away ] 
oh , god . 
fantastic ! 
what ? ! that would ' ve solved all my problems . 
oh , you idiot . 
if you left , i wouldn ' t have to fire anybody . 
big deal . oh , it would ' ve worked out so well . can you get it back ? 
you can call . can you call ' em ? 
wohahah ! why are you torturing me ? ! god . 
 [ clearing his throat and interrupting jim ' s talking head ] can i speak to you a minute ? 
help . me . 
i want you to role play firing me . i want you to fire me , and i will take it . 
yes . 
i want you to be me , and i will be creed . 
no , no , no . that ' s just the first thing . . . came . . . in head . 
yes , that ' s a good idea . 
aaaahh ! i ' m gonna kill myself ! 
i ' m going to kill myself , and it ' s your fault ! 
corporate is really breathing down my neck . and they ' re saying this has to be done by the end of the month . 
i . . . this is creed . 
i ' m improvising , so just try to keep up . [ phone rings ] 
and i ' m very angry , and i want . . . 
i ' m gonna kill you . i ' m going to kill you for firing me . 
get off , get off . no , no . ok . . just get off . [ sits back down in his chair and waves jim off . ] just , just . . . yeah . 
uh , hey . . . creed ? 
could i talk to you for a second ? 
you are great . very ambitious . and i feel like you want more than this little office has to offer . and i understand that you ' d wanna just spread your wings , and fly the coop . 
i . . . we ' re gonna have to . . . you . . . you want something better . 
no , you wanna leave . 
why . . . why are you making this so hard ? 
i think you ' re right . 
no , of course you can ' t go . we haven ' t even started this horrible process of . . . okay , creed . i need to let somebody go today . they told me i need to let somebody go . and as much as i think you ' re a great guy , and i like you , you ' re . . . you ' re , goodbye . 
hmm ? 
what old days ? what are you talking about ? 
it ' s right here on the desk , yeah . 
i can ' t , i can ' t . . . 
i can ' t change anything . this is the way . . . 
i don ' t . . . okay , just listen . 
don ' t . . . 
yeah , i went hunting once . shot the deer in the leg , had to kill it with a shovel . took about an hour . why do you ask ? 
i have to fire someone today , okay ? 
okay , well . . . i already picked you . and you know that . so , unless i just go through with this , you ' re always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you . 
don ' t . . . 
devon , could i talk to you for a sec ? 
well , he . . . 
well , maybe i did . 
huh . no ! i can ' t , no . i can ' t go back . i would look like an idiot . 
no . 
no . it was all the stuff that i said . it was the business downturn , the cutbacks , and , and . . . 
i just hope that you and i can remain friends . 
devon , wait , please . 
look , look . in addition to severance , and everything , i want to give you this gift certificate to chili ' s . from me . okay ? no hard feelings . 
i love halloween . you know , it ' s just , it ' s just fun . every year , it ' s just fun . last halloween i came as janet jackson ' s boob . it was topical . people got a . . . a big kick out of it . the year before that , i came as monica lewinsky , and i wore a stained dress . the year before that , i also came as monica lewinsky . and before that , i was o . j . it was pretty funny . oh , i wish you were here last year . 
he . . . hey , hey , hey , hey ! how you doing ? wow ! you guys looks great . 
you look great ! and you ' re a princess ? 
a fairy princess . you ' re very . . . . 
you ' re a lion . [ trying to to open a bag of candy ] wow , i want to hear your , your . . . oh ! [ the bag tears open , spilling all the candy ] oh , okay , that ' s all yours . that ' s all yours . grab it , grab it . you know what ? you guys are getting all of these . 
hey , you . big jim . and phyllis . working hard , phyllis ? 
of course . you ' re always working hard . 
keep it up . and there ' s stanley . no costume ? well , no , not trying to fit in . i wish i had your confidence , i really do . 
no , no . what could possibly be wrong ? everything ' s great . just keep living your lives . everything ' s gonna be fine . [ sighing ] you are all such wonderful , innocent people . 
what ? what ? 
fine . if you are so anxious to see a head roll , it ' s you . there . you brought it on yourself . too bad . can ' t say that i ' m sorry . it ' s a relief . 
you asked for a name , i gave you a name . now you ' re not doing your job . why don ' t you just resign ? 
just know that if i could have fired you , i would have . 
i ' m going to have to do this sopranos - style . just whack him . guys , could you take the freight elevator , please ? 
you know what ? that ' s my foot . 
you guys . . . 
i will handle it in the best way possible , but in case he or she goes postal , you will be available to subdue . am i correct ? 
i don ' t know . hey , are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building ? 
oh , shoot . okay , well , just have your pepper spray ready . 
all right . all right , this is it . by the time i get back to our floor , i will have decided . [ elevator bell dings ] wow , that ' s a fast elevator . 
i have a proposal , everybody . listen up . now , corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts , but i refuse to fire anyone . so , i was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10 % pay cut and that would save the money . yeah ? 
okay , great . fine . well , then , if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down , you know who to blame . stanley . not the guy who was trying to be creative . [ turns around to find toby standing behind him ] 
leave me alone , okay ? 
do you want some coffee ? 
 [ slurping ] oh , wow . how long have you worked here ? how many years , creed ? 
yeah , that ' s right . fifteen years and three months . wow , you were hired before i was . must be thinking about retirement . 
why ? 
it ' s just that you never got married and you live in an apartment . 
yeah . 
just trying to be your friend . 
of course , i did . i always . . . yes , i do . 
are you pulling my leg or . . . 
you have no clue why i ' ve asked you in here ? 
oh , here we go . this . . . um , here ' s the deal . 
yes . actually , i have . i have been on a hunting trip . i shot a deer in the leg . i had to . . . i had to hit him , i had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour , so he . . . that ' s good eating , though . venison ' s very gamey . it ' s hard to watch , though . it ' s hard to . . . it ' s hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour . that . . . i haven ' t been hunting since then . i , i . . . ' cause that ' s , you know , where ' s the joy in that ? where ' s the . . . there ' s no sport , really . especially when you ' re the one with the shovel . and they ' re the one just lying there . um . . . i would have rather hit it with my car or something and just . . . i was just smacking the hell out of that thing . that was a mess . and we just left him there . i didn ' t eat it . i didn ' t want to eat that . that guy . why do you ask ? 
his name was devon . 
the human being man ' s name was devon . 
 [ talking over jan ] yes , yes , yes . 
yes , it is . 
uh , well , i am . a little . justifiably . my halloween is ruined . 
do you ? i don ' t think you do . devon was one of my best buddies . and now he hates me . 
 [ talking over jan ] you ' re glad ? 
thanks . thanks so much . you think it was good ? 
 [ talking over jan ] think i did a good job ? great . i feel good . i ' m gonna give myself a pat on the back . 
there . i ' m doing it . right there . great . 
 [ camera pans over , michael is sitting in a chair ] yeah , blah , blah , blah . 
you people are revolting . by far , the least popular people here . i should have fired you . who knew devon was so popular and had so many friends . so well - loved . 
 [ singing and tapping on his coffee mug ] i don ' t want to work , i just want to bang on this mug all day . 
uhh , yes , i did , here ' s the dizzle . i have a very top secret mission for you . i want you to update all the emergency contact information . 
 [ to pam ] hello , oh god , busy work . ahh , get away , cretin . 
yes , thank you . i know where to sign . 
last year they were out of order , weren ' t they pam ? 
chillax , pam . stop pam - m - s - ing . that ' s pretty good . um , actually , i ' m sending ryan on a top secret mission . tell her what it is . 
is it a priority ? oh i don ' t know , um , what if there is a tornado , pam ? people ' s legs are crushed under rubble . " please , would you be so kind as to call my wife ? no , i can ' t because we don ' t have any emergency contact information because pam said it wasn ' t a priority . " think . think with your head , pam . ok , well . she walks out . that ' s the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you . 
catch - 22 . yes . why don ' t you give me your contact information to start with , ok , what ' s your cell ? 
 [ in his office on his cell phone , talking in a fake high voice ] hey ryan . this is michael jackson calling from wonderland . 
this is tito . 
calling from . . . [ ryan hangs up ] 
 [ taps on the glass in his office to get ryan ' s attention ] pick up . 
 [ in a high pitched voice ] this is mike tyson . 
and this is more a ying - yang thing . the ' michael ' all cursive , the ' scott ' all caps . left brain , right brain . or , duality of man . 
yeah , yeah , i don ' t think that would happen . 
because i would kick his ass . 
so ? i ' ve beaten up black belts . 
they told me . after . you see , i used to run with a very tough crowd . street fighter types . real , real bad people , i ' m just lucky i got out . 
and after that , nobody ever messed with the ' damn rascals ' ever again . 
you were a jet ? 
yes , in theory , i have . i just need to cross some t ' s and dot some i ' s . alright , i ' m going to be in my office if anybody needs me . [ puts dwight in a headlock ] hoo - hah . oh , wow , sleeper hold . that ' s my rebuttal . shhh . hoo . you are the weakest link . 
i ' m friends with everybody in this office . we ' re all best friends - i love everybody here . but sometimes your best friends start coming into work late , and start having dentist appointments that aren ' t dentist appointments . and that ' s when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up . 
just hit me . you ' ll see . 
oh , queer . . . [ realizes he is on camera ] eye . queer eye . that ' s a good show . important show . go ahead . do it . 
oh yeah , that would be kind of worthless because i know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass . 
look , dwight is a wuss . when we rented ' armageddon ' . . . 
 . . . he cried at the end of it . he did . 
oh , bruce willis . are they going to leave him on the asteroid ? 
ok , here we go . alright , come on . 
fuuuaaaahhhhh . . . oohhhhh ! 
yeah . [ jim opens office door for michael ] thank you . 
 [ pam knocks on his door ] go away . 
i haven ' t signed them , ok ? 
come in . um , pam , i hate to break this to you but dwight can ' t stop you from being mugged . he ' s just not tough enough . 
oh , i could beat up dwight . that ' s ridiculous . i could murder him . 
oh , so that ' s what they are saying ? 
ok , alright , where is dwight ? 
ok . 
watch out kelly , he might sucker punch you . 
no , really ? 
really ? well , the offer , dwight , was for one punch which i absorbed . i had no idea that there would be a second punch . so , catch - 22 . 
look , if we were in a bar right now , there would be two punches : me punching you and you hitting the floor . 
really ? 
you know what ? you ' re just lucky that we are at work right now . 
no , they must have class . 
look . . . 
hey , toby . 
i ' ve got an idea : why don ' t you leave right now . why don ' t you walk away from the room , ' kay ? fine . we ' ll go at lunch . pam , make an announcement . figure out carpools . 
i recognize that . that is japanese for california roll . 
i think it is . a guy told me about that . 
oh . 
alotta rules . alotta rules . on the street we didn ' t have any rules . maybe one - no kicks to the groin , home for dinner . 
hey ! 
what the hell was that ? 
no . 
alright , that ' s the way you want it . 
play dirty , huh ? ok , game on , man . 
i ' m comin ' atcha man . ok , purple belt , ok . i got him . 
i got his pants . 
dwight , you have . . . no , you have something . . . god , you look like such an idiot ! [ lots of yelling and flailing of arms by michael and dwight ] 
go on , i dare you to kick there again . kick there again , i dare ya . 
you can ' t see . you can ' t see . good boy . good boy . great boy . two points , three points , four points . i win . i win . [ michael is using his head guard to hit dwight ] eight points . nine points . [ begins to hock a loogie ] 
open your mouth . 
you talkin ' to me ? you talkin ' to me ? " raging bull . " pacino . oh , i want that footage . i want it . i need it . ah , i have to get back to work . i have lots of work . . . oh , oh check this out . come here . [ michael opens his blinds and looks at ryan in the parking lot ] there he is . mr . temp . having lunch by the car . let us play with him . this ' ll be hilarious . [ calls ryan on the phone , ryan doesn ' t pick up after seeing that michael is calling ] oh , we ' re playing phone tag . 
my emergency contact is todd packer . todd f . packer . do you know what the f . stands for ? 
 [ knock at the door ] yeah . . . uh , come in . oh , hey karate kid . the hillary swank version . hi . how are ya ? 
he is such a sore loser . you heard , obviously , that i mopped the floor with him this afternoon . you know what , um , do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and i will call the hospital . cut out the middle man . 
 [ knock at the door ] yeah . 
yeah , just throw them on the chair . i ' ll take it from here . so , whatcha up to this weekend ? 
if you ' re doing anything crazy , give me a shout . 
alright , bye . 
dwight ? 
this close . dwight , may i speak with you for a minute ? 
well , [ points at himself ] busier . making the time . 
well , you don ' t even have anyone to go home to , toby . 
i know , but i ' ve been carrying the load on my back all day , and if everybody would just chip in a little bit , it ' d might help me out . what do you say ? let ' s gangbang this thing and go home . good ? dwight . 
i have been testing you the entire day . did you know that ? 
and i am happy to say that you have passed . so effective immediately i am promoting you from assistant to the regional manager to assistant regional manager . 
i know , i know , i know , i wouldn ' t be offering it if i didn ' t think you could handle it . 
no , no , title change only . 
no , no . three month probationary period . let ' s not tell anybody about this right now . 
absolutely but not really . 
yes you do . 
and , ditto . 
i told dwight that there is honor in losing . which , as we all know , is completely ridiculous , but there is , however , honor in making a loser feel better which is what i just did for dwight . would i rather be feared or loved ? um , easy . both . i want people to be afraid of how much they love me . and i think i proved that today at the dojo . 
yeah , i don ' t think that would happen . see , i used to run with a very tough crowd , street fighter types . real , real bad people . i ' m just lucky i got out . i was a bad ass mo - fo . stanley knows what i ' m talking about . 
i ' ve never lost a fight . you know why ? my motto . never say die . 
no , that ' s not how i meant it . 
shut up , dwight . 
yes . 
oh . well , in my office , if you took off your shoes , it would be a sign of disrespect . stinkyfeetville . kind of a ying - yang . [ exclaiming ] oh , stretchin ' . i like to stay tight . compact . [ dwight screaming ] 
do you have , do you have anything in , like , black ? 
god , you look like such an idiot . [ both yelling ] [ grunting ] 
stan the man . 
did you hear about the fight ? well , it wasn ' t much of a fight , actually . 
i opened a big can of whoop - ass on him . 
i went medieval on his heinie . 
hey , stanley . i don ' t tell you how to do your job , do i ? he . . . 
grow a pair , stanley . right ? there not gonna downsize because i miss a lot of deadlines . that ' s not how business works , okay ? [ sighs ] okay . 
 [ door opening ] all right . here you go , princess . just finished with part one . 
yes , under my tutelage . 
if you didn ' t badger me with so many questions , pam , i could be done with it by now . 
wow , graphs and charts , somebody ' s really been doing their homework . looks like usa today . 
i changed it . to chili ' s . 
radisson just gives out this vibe , " oh , i ' m doing business at the radisson " . it ' s kind of snooty . so . 
here ' s the thing . chili ' s is the new golf course . it ' s where business happens . small businessman magazine . 
it will . i sent it in . letter to the editor . 
uh huh , uh huh . [ under his breath ] power trip . 
ok , let ' s do this thing . [ to pam ] wish us luck . 
 [ under his breath ] kiss ass . ok , probably going to go late tonight . burning the midnight tequila . so , i think you could all just take off now . 
well . . . 
no , no . that would not be efficient . actually , they just don ' t get very much work done when i ' m not here . [ jan stares at michael ] that ' s not true . i know how to delegate , and they do more work done when i ' m not here . not more . the same amount of work is done , whether i am here or not . [ another jan stare ] hey , everybody , listen up . this is what we ' re gonna do . you sit tight , until i return . sound good ? doesn ' t matter , it ' s an order . follow it blindly , mwahahaha , ok ? alright , ciao . [ to oscar ] adios ! 
uh , i ' ll drive . 
it ' s just a couple blocks away , so . . . boy , you really don ' t know scranton , do you ?

you ever been to scranton , jan ? dar de - 
dar de dar . 
jan levinson - gould . jan is cold . if she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn ' t moving , you might think she was dead . 
we should come up with a signal of some sort . 
well , in case one of us gets into trouble , the other one can signal - 
well , i . . . it could be either of us . 
yeees . 
hello ? christian ? 
thought that was you . hi . michael scott . this is jan levinson - gould .

i heard a - 
very very funny joke the other day . wanna hear it ? 
ok . 
just one joke . ok . well , if it ' s just gonna be one , i will think of a different joke . umm . . . let ' s see . . . choo choo choo . 
pam , it ' s michael . i need you to go into my office and check some data for me . 
yes . 
no . 
nope . told it . not as good as you think . pick another one . 
oh ho ho , yea ! bingo ! and a lighthouse . yes . that is hysterical . could you start that one from the beginning ? 
first guy says " well , i ' m an astronaut , so i drive a saturn " . and the second guy says , " well , i am a pimp , so i drive a cheap escort " . and the third guy says " i gotcha both beat , i ' m a proctologist , so i drive a brown probe " . 
 [ making the mouth on his tie talk ] yum ! yum yum yum ! [ christian laughs ] that ' s delicious ! i love it ! 
bop ! be blah bop , be boo boo bop . 
that ' s why i wanted a signal , between us , so that i wouldn ' t have to just shout non - sense words . that ' s her fault . 
did somebody say " baby back ribs " ? hmmm ? hmmmmm ? 
 [ singing ] i want my baby back , baby back , baby back [ christian laughs ] 
 [ singing ] chili ' s baby back ribs . . . 
woo , well , this brings us to jan . truth or dare ? tell us about your divorce . ohh , ohh . 
oh , so you ' re not gonna play ? she ' s not playing . 
she ' s not playing the game . 
check please . 
no , you were not stupid . gould was stupid . right ? 
you know ? 
it ' s true . 
uh huh , kenneth road , born and raised . spent my whole life right here in lackawanna county and i do not intend on movin ' . i know this place . i know how many hospitals we have , i know how many schools we have . it ' s home , you know ? i know the challenges this county ' s up against . here ' s the thing about those discount suppliers . they don ' t care . they come in , they undercut everything , and they run us out of business , and then , once we ' re all gone , they jack up the prices . 
it ' s bad . 
it , you know what , it really is . 
well , corporate ' s gonna go ballistic , but , uh , you think we could jan ? 
 [ waving to christian ] see ya . 
we did it ! 
nailed it . nailed it ! come here .

[ laughs ] no , seriously , guys , i ' m not , i don ' t want to go into it at all . it ' s off limits . fine , i took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while . it was great . i mean she told me about her divorce , we talked for about five hours , she fell asleep on my arm . so . 
hello , dwight . 
who . 
uh , no , no , no gould . 
this is none of your affair because she is your boss - 
and she is a woman . she is a strong , soft , thoughtful , sexy woman . and you know what ? i don ' t think that i can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor . [ to camera ] jan , i defend your honor . [ to dwight ] is that all ?

jan ! to what do i owe this pleasure ? 
well , hello to you , too . um , yeah , i was just um , i just wanted to get some closure on uh , what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the chili ' s . 
well , surely this uh , review is a formality because of what happened uh , at our meeting in the parking lot of chili ' s . 
oh . 
been thinking about you . 
um , i don ' t see how that ' s unprofessional . just - 
yep . 
no . 
they are not . yes , they are . [ jan hangs up ] that ' s my girlfriend . 
pam , i have ideas on a daily basis . i know i do . i have a clear memory of telling people my ideas . um , is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down ? in a folder ? a " michael - idea " folder ? 
that ' s unfortunate . how ' bout the suggestion box ? there ' s tons of ideas in there . 
the suggestion box that i put out , and people could be put in suggestions anonymously ? maybe there ' s prizes ? 
why don ' t you find it and tell people to get theirs . . . never mind , i ' ll tell them . hello , everybody ? yeah , uh , attention , please . jan levinson ' s coming , very soon , and so , we ' re going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting , so you can all get your constructive compliments in a . s . a . p . 
what did i say ?

hi , jan . how are you ? 
good to see you . 
ok . [ tries to kiss jan ' s hand ] ok , why don ' t we just step into my office ? we ' re gonna go in here .

alright [ takes jan ' s coat ] . 
it ' s nice to see you . 
really ? 
oh , well . 
alright . 
yep . 
absolutely . 
i ' m a little confused . ' cause first it ' s all like kissy - kissy . and then it ' s like all regret . because " oh , i regret that . " but , " wait , i ' m still gonna call you . " but , but , " we ' re just gonna talk business . and i may come down and fire you if you don ' t do your job . " but what were talking about when we first kissed ? business . 
no , no , no , i finished all of that . i ' m very fast . i ' m not too fast . not like wham - bam - thank ya ma ' am . but i do say thank ya ma ' am . but , i ' m , i ' m not like wham - bam . not that there ' s anything wrong with wham - bam . if it ' s consensual . [ cold jan stare ] we ' re talking about office stuff . can i ask you a question ? 
this is a business question . it ' s nothing personal , i promise . 
are you wearing a new perfume today ? 
well , you ' re wearing it at the office . and [ smells jan ] it , i ' m sorry , but no offense , but it ' s really sexy . 
i don ' t understand - [ phone rings ] hold on . sorry . [ answers ] yes , pam . 
i ' m kind of in the middle of something . i wish you wouldn ' t interrupt . 
i did not , not , not use those words . 
no , it ' s in like ten minutes . 
why are we here ? because i value your opinions . now , i know a lot of don ' t think that i read your suggestions , but i do . i just sift through them every week and i really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing . um , so , let ' s , uh , just read some of these suckers . alright . number one : " what should we do to prepare for y2k ? " 
well , obviously this one got stuck in the box . [ to jan ] that happens occasionally . 
and , um , one down . next suggestion : " we need better outreach for employees fighting depression " . ok , alright , enough with the jokes . nobody in here is suffering from depression . 
oh , ok , well , yeah , who wrote it ? 
tom . then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named tom . 
oh , that guy ? that guy was weird . alright , next suggestion . 
arrr , dooby dooby do . " you need to do something about your b . o . " 
ok , i don ' t know who this suggestion is meant for , but it ' s more of a personal suggestion and it ' s not an office suggestion . far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody . 
well , toby , if by me you are inferring that i have b . o . , then i would say that is a very poor choice of words . 
was i , creed ? ! ok , well , you know what ? i am implying is that when we ' re on an elevator together , i should maybe take the stairs , because talk about stank . not that i would ever say something like that in public , and i never have , and i never will . i just think it ' s something that we should all be aware of . ok ? now that we ' ve learned this , let ' s continue . see , this is good , we ' re learning and we ' re figuring some stuff out . " you need to do something about your coffee breath " - 
ok . 
shut up , shut up , shut up , dwight , ok . i don ' t think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box . 
yeah , is that hard for you ? alright , well - 
i ' ll work on that - 
let ' s keep going . keep it going . yep . what do we have here ? we have somebody ' s piece of gum . somebody put a piece of gum in there . this is not a , a garbage can , this is the future of our company . this is not a place for gum . i don ' t wanna have to read these tomorrow . 
yeah , what ? uh , alright , next suggestion . 
 " don ' t sl - " , ok , that ' s blank [ dwight picks up note ] don ' t , just put it - 
i don ' t understand why you ' re so upset . 
let me ask you - 
ok , let me ask you this . 
let me ask you something . 
where did you get your outfit ? 
i just don ' t understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened . 
look - 
oh my god . . . 
what do you want dwight ? 
ok , great . your performance has been adequate . you may leave ; goodbye . 
you wanna talk now , good ; ok , dwight , leave . 
why on earth would we give you a raise ? 
you do ? how do you get in ? 
that is a serious offense . very serious . as is toying with a man ' s heart . 
ok , third wheel , why don ' t you do that ? 
that was deer ! ? gross , oh ! 
oh , did not ! 
what do you say , jan ? 
ok . you just , uh , clear your head . 
that ' s from superman ? 
wait . 
wait , wait , wait , come , i just , i just wanna know why ? 
ok , so you ' re saying that there is a different time or place ? 
well , ok , well never as in ' never ever ever ' , or never as in there ' s still a chance ? 
i just want to know , from the horse ' s mouth , what is the dealio ? 
am i too short ? 
really ? 
i appreciate that , thank you . 
no , i wasn ' t , i didn ' t cry - 
so my looks have nothing to do with it ? 
jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now . and it doesn ' t matter how great a guy i am . and that is all i needed ; i ' m good . i can go home now . 
hey , it ' s 12 : 20 ; where the hell ' s dwight ? 
never missed a day , my ass . 
oscar , i ' m ready for you . 
so . . . 
um , you ' re in accounting . . . 
so , good , good , good . something to work toward , being here more . i ' m a big believer in people being here more . 
all right . 
yup . 
absolutely . 
 " i am not going to discuss anything outside of dunder mifflin business , period . " okay . now , why would jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period ? god , i don ' t understand women . how about a clear signal , right ? is that too much to ask ? 
yes , it is . 
yes , i did . 
hell , yeah . 
yeah . 
what ? 
kind of , yeah . over the shirt , my elbow , but . . . 
um , yup , wait , yes . 
no , there . . . later there was . 
yes . 
i didn ' t , you know , it was . . . it was dark , for one thing . 
let ' s just push on , shall we ? 
it ' s next . just keep it . " look on the supply shelf . " what ? what is that ? all right , ryan , look on the supply shelf , would you ? 
okay , yeah . 
okay . 
okay , field trip ' s over . come on . could we please get back to this ?

well . . . 
crystal . 
how pleasant . you can . . . 
okay , i think we ' re good . 
yeah , that got a little out of control . jan ' s taking a break , which is fine . i ' m doing the same , just chilling . getting my mind off of us . she ' s right . i need to be more professional at the office . when i ' m at work , i need to focus on work . i should call her ex - husband . 
hello , is this r . gould ? hi there . my name is michael scott , i work at dunder mifflin . i believe i work with your wife , ex - wife , jan . yeah , that ' s right , yes . um . . . i was wondering if i could ask a personal question about her . mmm - hmm . okay , well , could i ask anyway ? uh - huh . well , i ' m just gonna ask . when you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get ? 
yeah , that gould is a real interesting guy , a gem . i can see why he and jan are no longer together . if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship , he was verbally abusive , he was curt . he was . . . he had an inability to communicate , shall i say ? he was emotionally unavailable . i don ' t know how she dealt with that as long as she did . 
never . . . 
well , then , gould wasn ' t kidding . 
nothing , i just . . . 
nothing . 
no , i did not . 
maybe i did . maybe i called him , i don ' t know . 
i . . . 
i didn ' t do that . i . . . maybe he called me . 
ex - husband , you have to let it go . 
what is an office ? is it a group of people ? maybe . is it an idea ? of course , yes . is it a living organism ? exactly , yes . and any single cell organism has to have a spine , and that ' s me . but the spine is always controlled by a brain , and that is jan . but the brain needs a heart , and that is me again . so ironic . you know what ? the heart is smarter than the brain . but the brain is so effing hot . 
it is friday morning and it is another beautiful day in scranton , pennsylvania . [ sees man in a turban outside ] oh my god . ohhh .

beep ! bop ! 
bommmm . bop ! onk onk . [ tin man voice ] oil can . oil can . 
oh , what ? no . that defeats the whole purpose . 
you know what the problem is ? 
the problem is that when people hear the term " big brother " , they immediately think it ' s scary or bad , but i don ' t . i think , wow , i love my big brother . 
meredith has an e - vite from jim . barbeque at jim ' s tonight . tonight ? wonder where my e - vitation is . click on guest list . angela , stanley , oscar , meredith , phyllis , kevin , creed . must be . . . . [ scrolls down list ] no . 
there ' s always a distance between a boss and the employees . it is just nature ' s rule . it ' s intimidation mostly , it ' s the awareness that they are not me . i do think that i am very approachable , as one of the guys . but maybe i need to be even approachabler . 
of course . hangin ' with my crew , crew that i am one of . hangin ' with my cup of noodles . this is a meal in a cup .

well , you kept - 
going into nuclear something ; that ' s not where the scene was going . 
well , it goes , it goes in the best direction , and that was not the best direction . 
well , he , michael scarn , that character , orders people around , and that ' s , you should of just gone -

i don ' t think there ' s any stronger choice than being a really strong character . 
well , it ' s , like , well , it ' s , you know , when refine it , refine a character down to its essence , that ' s . . . 
exactly , thank you . 
i appreciate that . 
or ryan stiles , something like that . 
you shouldn ' t have been , ' cause you were dealing with michael scarn . that was exactly what i was hoping to achieve , so that is probably the best thing you could have said , that ' s a compliment . 
good work . 
i ' ll just throw out some suggestions . 
they ' re in a whorehouse .

presents are the best way to show someone how much you care . it ' s like this tangible thing that you can point to and say , " hey , man , i love you this many dollars worth . " 
no , don ' t ! 
whoa . wow . jeez . somebody really got carried away with the spirit of christmas . that was me , i got a little carried away . 
you don ' t know that . 
i did ? 
what ? oh , shoot . wow . okay , well , who cares ? it doesn ' t matter what i spent . what matters is that christmas is fun , right ? 
oh hey , for me . what is in here ? [ opens a handmade oven mitt ] oh , come on . 
an oven mitt ? okay . [ walks out ] 
so phyllis is basically saying , " hey michael , i know you did a lot to help the office this year but i only care about you a homemade oven mitt ' s worth . " i gave ryan an ipod . 
i got it ! we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap . 
one person chooses a gift . the next person can either choose a gift or steal that person ' s gift . if your gift gets stolen , then you can steal somebody else ' s gift or choose a new gift . 
well , i call it fun ! 
because it ' s better . because it ' s more special . 
shut it . no , it ' s not . okay , just give it a shot . 
okay , meredith is up first . here ' s the deal . you can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else ' s gift that they ' ve already gotten , like the oven mitt . 
yankee swap ! that ' s what makes it fun . pam , you can steal the oven mitt now . 
i think this is going great . 
everyone wants the ipod . it ' s a huge hit . it is almost a christmas miracle . 
oh , well , oscar , you little gourmand , you have the next turn . 
 [ holding oven mitt ] i hope nobody takes this baby , cause this is great . wow , look at that fine craftsmanship . somebody really put a lot of work into that . it ' s beautiful . 
sucker ! see , i wanted somebody to take it . boom ! reverse psychology . 
reverse psychology is an awesome tool . i don ' t know if you guys know about it , but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid . works like a charm . 
 [ opens present ] " in addition to these paintball pellets , your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute . " 
who wants to take paintball lessons ? how is that better than an ipod ? 
last gift . kevin . 
 [ after phyllis leaves suddenly ] what is she so upset about ? 
come on ! i think that yankee swap was a big hit ! i think it ' s a success and i ' m the one who ended up with dwight ' s stupid paintball pellets . 
well , i didn ' t . i got a big bonus because i fired devon , and i used the money to buy something awesome . sue me ! 
it wasn ' t . it wasn ' t that much . it was $ 3 , 000 . 
unbelievable . i do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out . well , happy birthday , jesus . sorry your party ' s so lame . 
all right , now , you ' re the expert . is this enough to get 20 people plastered ? 
cool , cool . box it up . 
uh - oh . looks like santa was a little naughty . 
this is christmas spirit , as in spirits , booze . 
zip it , toby ! just . . i mean , it ' s a party . come on . if i can ' t throw a good party for my employees , then i am a terrible boss . who wants a drink ? 
go , here we go ! 
anybody making out in here ? [ checks hallway ] not yet , give it time . oh , hey , ebenezer , boink . [ takes picture of jim ] okay , how ' s it going in here ? [ takes picture of meredith and kevin ] 
no , no , no , no . we ' ll find some , don ' t leave the party . 
kudos to ryan , king of the party committee . 
yeah , yeah , yeah . 
oh , no , no . no false modesty , my friend . 
not bad . and if it couldn ' t go to ryan , you are the guy i ' d want it to go to . 
you ' re welcome . 
no way . oh , you ' re kidding me . packer ! yes ! todd packer , ladies and gentlemen ! 
oh , no , no . oh look at that . icing on the cake . 
oh , let ' s fix you up . who wants to fix up . . toby . toby ' s gonna fix you up . 
darryl . there you go . [ hands him the santa hat ] you earned it . 
no , no , no , no . i really , really want you to have it . 
hey , merry christmas . 
 [ coming out of his office ] lampshade on head ! it ' s happening ! 
yeah , that sounds good . 
christmas is awesome . first of all , you get to spend time with people you love . secondly , you can get drunk and no one can say anything . third , you give presents . what ' s better than giving presents ? and fourth , getting presents . so , four things . not bad for one day . it ' s really the greatest day of all time . 
hey , meredith . heading over to poor richard ' s ? 
cool , cool , cool . do you need a ride ? [ meredith drops her top . michael takes a picture ] all right , let ' s head out . sounds good . do you have a coat ? 
okay ! 
remember on that animated special when they taught the uh , the monster to put the star on top ? that ' s dwight . dwight ' s the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree . you take his teeth out , and he could put the star on top of the tree . 
phyllis and angela and meredith are helpers . i guess angela ' s kind of . . . angela ' s little . phyllis and meredith are not little . pam is sort of a medium helper . 
dwight is . . . dwight looks like spock to me . he always wears the ears , and i always give him grief about looking like spock , and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be spock , for some reason . 
well , thank god you didn ' t steal my oven mitt . and oscar , you little gourmand , your turn . 
oscar , paint ball pellets . 
yeah . like anybody would want an oven mitt . [ phyllis gets up and leaves the party ] 
see , that ' s what christmas is all about to me , is when you see someone open a gift and you think , " man , i wish i got that . " i mean , that ' s just such a great feeling , to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else . i don ' t know , it ' s just . . . i don ' t know , just makes you kind of feel good . 
hello , everyone . 
ah ! ha ha ha ! 
yeah ? 
stanley ! bo banley . 
banana fana fo fanley . 
be my mo manley . 
stanley . 
maybe . the suspense is just so exciting , isn ' t it ? 
maybe , i don ' t know . 
well , no . but . . . okay , don ' t spoil it for everybody , all right ? but we are going on a booze cruise on lake wallenpaupack . 
it ' s cheaper . 
this is not just another party . this is a leadership training exercise . right ? i ' m going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind - blowing experience . 
it is now time to unveil the destination of this year ' s retreat . we are going on a harbor cruise of lake wallenpaupack . it ' s a booze cruise ! 
no . this is mandatory . but don ' t worry , you know what ? you ' re gonna learn plenty . this is gonna turn your life around , ryan . 
well , this . . . 
yeah ? 
to throw you off the scent . 
well , just keep the tags on and you can return it . 
well , that ' s not my fault , okay ? just . . we ' re not going to pay for a bathing suit . okay , i know what you ' re all thinking , " who is this smart little cookie ? " her name is brenda . . . something , and she is from corporate . and she is here , like you , to learn from what i have to say . 
i am a great motivational speaker . i attended a tony robbins event by the airport last year , and . . . it wasn ' t the actual course . you have to pay for the actual course . but it talked about the actual course . and i ' ve incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course . 
leader . . . ship . the word " ship " is hidden inside the word " leadership , " as its derivation . so if this office is , in fact , a ship , as its leader , i am the captain . but we ' re all in the same boat . teamwork ! 
now , on this ship that is the office , what is a sales department ? anyone ? 
yes , darryl , the sales department makes sales . good . let me just explain . i see the sales department as the furnace . 
all right , let ' s not get hung up on the furnace . this just . . . it ' s the sales . . . i see the sales department down there . they ' re in the engine room , and they are shoveling coal into the furnace , right ? i mean , who saw the movie titanic ? they were very important in the movie titanic . who saw it ? show of hands ! 
titanic ? 
no , i ' m leo dicaprio ! come on ! 
no ! thank you , spoiler alert . you saw the movie , those of you who did . they ' re happy down there in the furnace room . and they ' re dirty and grimy and sweaty , and they ' re singing their ethnic songs , and . . . actually , that might be warehouse . 
the . . . no , no . no , i didn ' t . . . okay . well , okay , in a nutshell , what i ' m saying is . . . leadership . we ' ll talk more about that on the boat . ship . 
 [ singing ] a three - hour tour , a three - hour tour . 
pam , you are mary ann ! we have the professor and ginger , welcome aboard . angela , you are mrs . howell . lovey . [ to kelly ] uh . . . the native . sometimes they come from neighboring . . . [ to stanley ] we have one of the globetrotters , i am the skipper , and dwight , you will be gilligan . 
i ' d rather die . hi , i am michael scott , i am the captain of this party . 
okay . 
in an office , when you are ranking people , manager is higher than captain . on a boat , who knows ? it ' s nebulose . 
hey , look ! i ' m king of the world ! 
and i am the regional manager of dunder - mifflin , michael scott . welcome , welcome ! 
okay ! so . . . 
right . 
but don ' t worry , you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight . 
i ' m your party captain too ! and you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on ! so we are gonna . . . 
rock it ! 
if the boat ' s a - rockin ' , don ' t come knockin ' ! 
yep . 
we ' re all gonna have a good time tonight ! 
hm ? okay . yep . 
having fun ? 
good . well , that is what scranton is all about . not like you new yawkers . 
well , we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the gilligan thing , so . . . right now , i was thinking . yes . okay , listen up all you dunder - mifflinites ! i would like to talk to you all about life preservers . now , one important life preserver in business is it support . 
so , okay . 
but before that , i have to do my presentation . 
all right , we ' ll have a motivational dance contest ! hit it ! yeah , okay , dancing ! it is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate ! 
sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that ' s always trying to teach people things . sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing . 
ah ! see , this is of general interest . it is about priorities and making decisions , using the boat as an analogy . what is important to you ? if the boat is sinking , what do you save ? 
no , no . salesmen and profit centers . 
okay , well , obviously you don ' t know anything about leadership . 
okay . 
not what i was looking for , but a good thought . 
i don ' t want to take credit for this , but roy and i were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices . right ? did i motivate you ? 
well . . . could have been either one of us , because we were pretty much saying the same thing . congratulations . that is great ! 
yes ! i can marry you as regional manager of dunder - mifflin ! 
then i ' ll give you away ! 
captain jack is a fart face . i ' m on medication . 
vomicillin . okay . all right . it ' s time to be boss . it ' s time to motivate . let ' s blow some minds here . okay , guys , guys , cool it . everybody , dunder - mifflin scranton employees , brenda , i have some very , very urgent news i need to tell everybody right now . listen up . the ship is sinking ! okay ? we ' re going down , right now . just wrap your heads around the reality of that . shh , please ! everybody , it ' s my turn now , okay ? captain jack is gone . in five minutes , this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake ! and there aren ' t enough spaces on the lifeboat ! who are we gonna save ? do we save sales ? do we save customer service ? do we save accounting ? this is a business scenario . right ? it ' s a scary . . . it ' s a . . . 
it ' s a predicament , and it ' s something that each and every one of us has to think about . 
i ' m in the brig . see ? the boat ' s not as corporate - friendly as advertised . what was the deal with the guy jumping overboard ? what was . . . if he had just waited and heard what i had to say , he would be motivated right now and not all wet . 
is somebody there ? 
captain jack has a problem with authority . 
he just totally lost it . if you ask me , he caused the panic . 
well , it ' s nice for you . your friend got engaged . 
roy said the first one didn ' t count . 
really ? you ' re kidding me . you and pam ? wow . i would have never have put you two together . you really hid it well . god ! i usually have a radar for stuff like that . you know , i made out with jan . . . 
yeah ? yep . well , pam is cute . 
well , if you like her so much , don ' t give up . 
bfd . engaged ain ' t married . 
never , ever , ever give up . 
it ' s a fake wheel , dummy . 
 [ knocking ] yeah . 
hello . 
of course , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
have a seat . 
oh , every man ' s dream . 
two ladies at once . what ? why are you looking at me like that ? okay , you heard something . um , yeah , it ' s a booze cruise , but it . . . there ' s more to the story than that . it . . . 
leadership off - site . uh , booze cruise is just a rhyme . . . 
yeah , i don ' t even know why i said booze cruise . i don ' t even think there ' s booze on the boat . 
of course . 
of course , of course . yes . yes . look , i have a whole program planned . jan , this program is going to change people ' s lives . i am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat . 
hello . 
oh , cool . cool . and maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night . awkward . that ' s . . . you know what . brenda , could jan and i have a moment alone ? 
really ? you seriously said that ? okay . brenda , could jan and i have a moment alone ? 
thanks . 
oh , okay . 
i ' ll see you later . 
i ' ll call you later . 
that ' s like . . . 
i ' ll call you , too . [ to brenda ] so . you are probably gonna get carded , so i can make you a fake id . we have a laminating machine . 
what is a sales department ? oscar , what do you think ? 
i ' m not giving you the answer . deck hands is one . and . . . 
no , i ' m first mate . you ' re second mate . i ' m first mate , as the captain . 
well , the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down . toby is the anchor . oh , god . he , well . . . [ to brenda ] tell you about toby later , he ' s awful . 
oh , hey , toby . so . . . it ' s an analogy . 
 [ toby running to get on the cruise ] hey ! what ' s wrong with you ? you missed the boat . 
idiot . 
no , no , no . that ' s his punishment for not being here on time . too bad , anchor ! 
your problem now , captain jack . 
hey . you know what the best way of studying is ? 
flash cards . 
you are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here . 
that is a great way to kill this party . not on my watch . let ' s , uh , . . . let ' s rock . let ' s rock some stuff here , okay ? [ playing badly ] okay . . . i ' m hearing a little too much reverb . [ feedback echoing ] can we down the reverb ? all right . follow my lead . [ playing smoke on the water ] does you guys know that ? take the bass . take the drums . what ? 
you know what ? i don ' t think it ' s in . . . 
that ' s not in tune . i don ' t know if you can . . . 
 . . . make much of out of it , creed . good luck to you . i don ' t know . it is a defective ax , my friend . 
good luck . 
those slide moves are just bush league . i hope i die before i ' m old . 
yeah ! toast ! 
that ' s my line ! that ' s my line , that ' s . . . i always say that at weddings . so i ' ll just think of something else to say . i . . . [ band starts playing ]

oh god ! 
oh god ! 
ok , buhhhh , i burned my foot very badly on my foreman grill and i now need someone to come and bring me into work . 
i enjoy having breakfast in bed . i like waking up to the smell of bacon , sue me . and since i don ' t have a butler , i have to do it myself . so , most nights before i go to bed , i will lay six strips of bacon out on my george foreman grill . then i go to sleep . when i wake up , i plug in the grill , i go back to sleep again . then i wake up to the smell of crackling bacon . it is delicious , it ' s good for me . it ' s the perfect way to start the day . today i got up , i stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot . . . that ' s it . i don ' t see what ' s so hard to believe about that . 
pam , could you come get me ? ! 
ok , could someone come and get me please , ryan ? 
there ' s no toilet paper here . could ryan . . . tell ryan to bring toilet paper . could you tell ' em that ? 
i tried hopping , kevin , and i bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance . 
 [ panicked ] no one wants to pick me up ! ? 
i ' m not sick ! i ' m burned !

i don ' t want dwight !

morning everyone . don ' t freak out . i forbid anybody to freak out . clearly , i have had a very serious accident , but i will recover , god willing . i just want to be treated normally today . normal would actually be good , considering the trauma that i ' ve been through .

burned my foot , pam . 
please stop popping my cast . thank you . 
ha ha ha . so where are you shipping . . . 
thank you . pam , messages please ?

i don ' t want any special treatment , pam . i just want you to treat me like you would some family member who ' s undergone some sort of serious physical trauma . i don ' t think that ' s too much to ask . 
no , i don ' t want some aspirin , yeah i ' m a little fussy . aspirin ' s not gonna do a damn thing . i ' m sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot .

i just saw him . 
ugh , forget it . i ' ll just get up myself . no ! uh , aaaahhh ! ah ! oh god ! 
can i have everyone ' s attention please ? phyllis , oscar , ryan , who ' s supposed to be dead , can i ask you all a question ? do you all know what it ' s like to be disabled ? oscar ? 
no , never heard of it . no , a real disability , not a woman ' s trouble . 
wuh , how , how old are you ? look , the point is , i am the only one here who has a legitimate disability , although i ' m sure stanley has had his fair share of obstacles . 
ok , [ lifts up cooked foot ] what does this look like to you stanley ? ! 
shuuut it , ok , well , well you know what , disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about . you people are jerks . imagine if you had left stevie wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me . 
 [ sigh ] i burned my foot ! ! ! ok , twenty minutes , conference room , everybody ' s in there ! 
while we are waiting for our special guest to arrive , i wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many , many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society . 
good question . forrest gump : mentally challenged , philadelphia [ points to a picture from big ] : aids . 
i don ' t think so , no . 
he grew into a man overnight . rare disability , still works . [ sigh ] a crossword puzzle stanley , seriously , are you learning nothing here ? 
what you mean uh hmmm . . . ? 
ok . 
yes , right in here , come on in . 
this , ladies and gentlemen , is our special guest . 
you are so brave . you are so brave . 
but it ' s hard for you ! right ? because you ' re in a wheelchair . 
let me ask you something , how long does it take for you to do something simple , every day , like brush your teeth in the morning ? 
oh my god , that ' s three times as long as it takes me . 
how did you get in your wheelchair ? 
hey , hey , hey , not funny ! not funny . 
well , that ' s good , he still has a sense of humor . 
well they notice it . don ' t you ? you notice it . it ' s the first thing you saw when he rolled in here , isn ' t it ? 
ok . . . 
ignore him . you know what ? we ' re not that different , you and i . when i clamped my foot into a non - stick . . . 
yeah . . . 
ok . 
did you see born on the fourth of july ? i was under the impression that billy would be more like that guy . 
 [ popping his bubble wrap cast ] hey ! 
you did it ! look at you , and with the plate and the napkin . very nice . thank you , ryan . 
did you get the yams ? 
 [ sigh ] ok , i ' ll just have the pudding . 
yeh . 
you know what ? i feel better . ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot . 
yeah , baby , i am feelin ' better . my body ' s literally healing itself . it is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain . 
uh , finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins . 
oh , now you feel some compassion for him . 
why don ' t you go with him ? 
i can ' t take you , i don ' t have my car and yours is all vomity . 
oh , ok , that ' s , great . no , i can ' t drive . jim why don ' t you drive . 
we ' ll go . i ' m still recovering . so let ' s just , ryan , could you get my coat please . 
shotgun ! 
the rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear . the first person to shout " shotgun " when you ' re within the sight of the car gets the front seat . that ' s how the game ' s played . there are no exceptions for someone with a concussion . 
oh , god , a mini - van . what is meredith ' s problem ? 
well , yeah she has one kid , no husband . she ' s not gonna find one driving this thing around . 
chuck e . cheese ? oh , god , i ' m so sick of chuck e . cheese .

what do i write under " reason for visit " ? 
nothing . i wrote " bringing someone to the hospital " . 
no . . . you know what jim , this isn ' t about me anymore . i made a miraculous recovery , which is more than i can say for him . [ dwight falls towards jim ] 
hi dwight . 
doctor , what is more serious , a head injury or a foot injury ? 
well , you don ' t have all the information . the foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly , very quickly , actually like suspiciously quickly . 
look since you have the machine up and running , can i just stick my foot , we take a look ? 
ok , what kinda machine is that ? 
that ' s my joke , damnit dwight . 
it ' s ok , they ' re with me . 
alright , well , i guess this is where we leave you off . 
uh , well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up . we ' ll , see you when you get out . 
fine . fine . 
uh , that ' s what she said . see , haven ' t lost my sense of humor . no , no need , it was a non - stick grill . 
i always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house . some days , hectic , tiring days , i just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few . very soothing . [ to the interviewer ] want to try ?

dwight ! hey is it me or does this place smell like up - dog ? 
gotcha ! [ laughing ] oh , god . [ low ] crap ! nothin ' how ya doing ? 
 [ low ] damn it . 
today is spring cleaning day here at dunder mifflin . and yes i know its january . i am not an idiot . but , if you do your spring cleaning in january ; guess what you don ' t have to do in the spring ? anything . they say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind . well i say that an empty desk means a . . .

i will do all the talking . 
what difference does it make whether your here ? 
hi , oscar its michael . 
yechh , yeah , um , heard you were under the weather ? 
really ? oh , that is a shame . you know it ' s cleaning day here today ? could have used some of that famous hispanic cleaning ethic . 
what are your symptoms ? 
umm , hmmm . 
i need you to go back to bed . i need you to get better . see you monday . unless you ' re still sick . so have a great long weekend . 
he sounded sick . 
that ' s exactly what i was thinking . 
yeah . drop what you ' re doing . make this a priority . because an office can ' t function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs . 
wowweee . mikey likey . why don ' t you wear your hair like that all the time . it ' s much sexier . [ pam puts hair back up ] [ michael walks by jim ] man , this must be torture for you . 
hey jim - bag .

i put a cigarette through a freakin ' quarter . and you know what toby ? they almost bought from us . 
look jim needed a relaxing lunch , he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity . how is that not work related ?

i cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there . 
how do you know that ? what is it , then ? 
 [ as cleaning lady with mask leaves ] here she comes . all cleaned ? great . [ walks into office ] 
that is worse . 
 [ while in his reeking office ] i am a big fear factor fan . i ' m a big fan of anything joe rogan does , actually , so this is sort of like my audition tape . um . . . [ clearing throat ] i can ' t stand it [ gets up to leave ] , i can ' t stay in here another second . no ! 
 [ sitting at jim ' s desk ] hey jim . i thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet . 
oh . . . it ' s . . . 
 [ reluctantly ] yeah . . . 
no , no , no ! seriously , i don ' t mind sharing . 
 [ putting his feet on desk ] yeah , yeah , yeah . old bullpen . 
don ' t ape me . 
this is great . 
the pressures of my office are insane . 
i just . . . you couldn ' t understand , but man , you guys have it so easy out here , you know ? i used to sit right here . 
yeah . 
ed truck . [ exclaiming is disgust ] ed truck was the manager before me . horrible . he hated fun . it was like , " oh , ed truck is walking toward us . stop having fun . start pretending to do work . " what a jerk . he ' s . . . you know what ? i swore to myself that if i ever got to walk around the room as manager , people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as i walked away . 
you know who used to sit at that desk ? 
mm - mm . todd packer . 
yeah . 
he was , but , uh . . . that desk was empty . he ' d come in and sit there sometimes . 
when i was in training , many years ago . . . not so long ago . . . i worked side - by - side with a fellow named todd packer , and together we rocked the office [ picture behind michael falls ] . packer and i once spent the whole day with our pants off , and when people noticed , we convinced them that they were crazy . 
i will gladly pay you tuesday for a hamburger today . 
oh , a customer , well , sound the alarm . [ laughs ] okay . 
another time , packer held this guy ' s head in the toilet for like a minute . guy had no sense of humor about it . probably why he wasn ' t hired . 
charley horse ! 
charley horse ! 
oh , okay . gah . 
once , as a joke , packer banged every chick in the office . [ giggles ] it was hysterical . 
 [ whispering ] dwight .

old fashioned raid . sales on accounting . yeah . follow my lead . 
hey guys . 
ahem . what ' s up ? 
yeah ! oh ho ho [ laughing ] 
no , no , no , no . we don ' t do that . we don ' t do that . 
watch out , pam . you ' re next ! 
maybe ! 
why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet ? i don ' t know . it could be done out of hate . it could be done out of love . it could be completely neutral . maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady . and , well , she doesn ' t do a very good job , obviously , because my office still reeks like you would not believe . i hate her . 
you know what ? i am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office . the only thing that makes any sense . 
stop . 
stop it . [ dwight hangs up ] stop . it . [ dwight beings to dial ] don ' t . don ' t . 
all right . 
hi , guys . 
i ' m just walking around . 
well , yeah .

yeah , paper business . is this done ? 
extreme home makeover puts together a house in an hour . if you were on that crew , you would be fired like that . [ snaps ] 
this was no act of god . a person did this . a person who works in this office . maybe all of them . 
you know what ? today is not a good day for a sales contest . we ' re . . . we ' re not . . . we ' re not doin ' this today . 
you wanna talk about fair ? does anyone need to smell my old carpet ? you explain to me how that was fair , and i ' ll explain to you how this is fair . plus i just . . . i think that picking today was sort of taking advantage . 
i am a victim of a hate crime . stanley knows what i ' m talkin ' about . 
well i hated it ! a lot ! okay , i . . . you know what ? if the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment , we ' d be done . [ no one comes forward ] very well . then you are all punished . 
you ' re all on a time out . just sit there quietly . [ phone rings , phyllis reaches to answer ] no . no ! [ phone continues to ring ]

oh , no , no , no . you ' re good . it was clerical . you ' re good . um , well , somebody did something in my office , and i now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me . 
i didn ' t get a good look at . . . it , but it smells horrible . 
really ? 
well , that figures . so how did you deal with people not liking you ? 
well . . . s - sure i can .

oh , i think it ' s going to work out great . because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job . and i haven ' t been there in months . 
so let ' s meet the warehouse ! let ' s get some shots . pan around there . this is darryl , one of our warehouse staff . darryl , what is your biggest fear ?

 [ video dialogue for " the faces of scranton " ] life moves a little slower in scranton , pennsylvania . and that ' s the way we like it . because at dunder mifflin scranton , we ' re not just in the paper business , we ' re in the people business . let ' s meet some of the folks that make the scranton branch so special . [ video shows stanley at desk ] this is stanley hudson , one of our talented salesman . an african - american father of two , stanley ' s dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark ' s of the foundation of the business we ' re hoping to build our bases on . 
yeah , i shot a bunch of footage around the office , edited it together on my mac . i was thinking of entering it into some festivals . probably won ' t . you know , not what this is about . 
 [ video dialogue ] and finally , pam beesly . look at her . look how cute . not bad at all . as the receptionist , pam is truly the gateway to our world . well , i hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at dunder mifflin , scranton . what it ' s like to walk a mile in oscar ' s shoes . or try on phyllis ' pants . maybe even one of angela ' s famous brownies . and you ' ll know , that you ' re home . [ video says , " great scott ! " ] 
questions ? 
yes , thank you . 
yes , absolutely david . get that for you . i umm . . . [ hands over report ] 
oh , ok . alright . 
no you ' re not . 
technically , we fell asleep in the same bed . so . . . 
yes . i ' m sorry . i will fix this . i ' ll talk to him . i ' ll talk to david . 
i am serious . and don ' t call me shirley . airplane . 
no no no no no , yes i , ok , well , alright , here ' s the deal . it ' s my fault . this is , this is totally on me . before you guys came in , i was talking to the guys . we were all chatting and i made a joke , a really dumb joke and craig the idiot took it seriously . [ jan looks at michael ] 
i did , it was stupid . and craig , you saw him , he ' s not the sharpest tool in the shed . although he is a tool . [ david grins ] 
i know . it was borderline at best and . . . and jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um , i ' m really sorry . it will never happen again . 
oh , no big deal . really . sorry again . 
yeah , happy valentine ' s day . [ jan turns and then kisses michael . michael looks and sees camera , jan turns and sees camera , too . elevator door closes . ] 
oy vey . . . schmear . [ points at fiddler on the roof playing at minskoff theatre and does a dance . ] 
everybody , hello , can i have your attention , please ? since it ' s valentine ' s day , there ' s something that i wanted to say . i love the women of this office . pam , i love you . 
i love you , angela . yes , even you . i love you , kelly . i love you , meredith . this is all platonically , of course . 
i love ladies , always have . and you know what i think is the most attractive part of a woman ' s body ? the brains . because i don ' t think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart . and also , the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff . 
that ' s a lot of noodles . how much sodium do you think is in that cup ? this place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it ' s not that way anymore . there ' s an old building . that one hasn ' t been torn down yet , but they will . they ' ll get to it . 
this is where it ' s all happening . we got tgi fridays . i ' m in the picture ! sometimes i just jump into people ' s pictures . lot of people have their picture taken . it ' s kind of a new yorker thing . you jump in on a tourist ' s picture and kind of ruin it . there ' s an energy to new york that you just feel . um , everybody . . . don ' t get hit . everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other , but loves each other at the same time . screw off ! people just yell at each other in new york , and it ' s great . 
great . thank you . 
okay , here ' s the thing about jan . she talks such a big game about , " oh there ' s nothing between us and stop talking about it . " and " border - line harassment when you call me at home . " but let me ask you this , is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on valentine ' s day ? answer , maybe , but maybe not . we shall see . 
you know what ? it was nice to see devon again . to sort of get closure on that whole thing . 
let ' s think this through . if we ask corporate for that then . . . 
could go either way . we don ' t know what they are going to say . 
have to think it through . because if they say no . . . 
no ! yes , we have to ! you know why ? because i don ' t like to be cooped up in that office ! in that box ! all day long . [ michael starts playing with a football in the office ] heisman ! because i need to think . okay , jim ? oh , kevin , oh ! [ laughs ] nice catch . mmmm , mmm , mmm , mmm . os - car ! intercepted . 
give it to me . phyllis , give me the ball . ok , give me the ball . give me , you guys . . . creed give me the ball ! right now give it to me . 
hey , dwight . 
you all right ryan ? 
pam ! 
that ' s what she said ! 
grapes . seductive . so you ready for the big speech this afternoon ? 
oh ! abso - fruit - ly . fruit . grapes . nailed the joke . matter of time . um . . . and yes , it is a big speech . biggest of your life . 
speaker at the sales convention . been there , done that . went there again , did it again . two years in a row . consecutive . i just . . . i miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it . sir , you ' re awesome ! here ' s a plaque . what , a whole year has gone by and you need more proof ? here ' s a certificate . they stopped making plaques that year . 
that would look terrible . these are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act . 
that ' s because you ' re incapable of doing it because you don ' t know how . because you have no skills . dwight , there ' s no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time . 
but i can teach you enough so that you don ' t embarrass me or the company . 
well , if you have a question , you should ask me . 
don ' t . don ' t try and think of a question to humor me . just . . . try not to be such an idiot . 
insult . 
 [ stand up comic voice ] but seriously , what ' s the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman ? 
it ' s a joke , dwight . it ' s not a sex ed class . 
yeah , you ' re right about the difference between a man and a woman , but not about the punch line to the joke , right ? [ stand up comic voice ] the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman . . . is boobs ! 
i do . both of them . 
no , no ! they would remember them . look , it doesn ' t matter what you say . it just matters that you ' re saying something that people care about . yeah ? all right ? here we go . watch this . 
attention everybody ! attention please ! i have some very great news from corporate . we had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars ! 
 [ generalized clapping and cheering ] congratulations . 
you see that ? you see how they responded to me ? in that moment , i had them . 
no , no ! it ' s not true . i was just talking so just go out there and say anything . they ' ll eat it up . they ' re a great audience . 
he ' s kidding . dwight was kidding and i don ' t know why because it wasn ' t funny . . . and it was just horrible . 
yeah . 
all right . everybody in the conference room now . let ' s go . let ' s do it . 
as your leader and your friend , i sort of demand that you can all speak in public as i can . . . and did . . . twice . [ speaking to camera ] you saw the plaque , right ? [ to office ] all right . we ' re all going to go around the room and we ' re going to make toasts . and that way , we will overcome our fear of public speaking . 
pam ! i ' m public speaking . stop public interrupting me . actually , this would be good practice for your wedding toast . 
yes . good . jim taking the initiative . 
oh ho hokay . you know what ? that ' s not a toast . you ' re not standing up . 
okay , dwight . show us what you have learned today . 
well , it ' s mostly made up . so . . . 
dwight is not going to do a job . it ' s sad . and they ' re expecting excellence because i did do such a good job . two years in a row . i killed . it was amazing . 
confidence , dwight . 
it ' s time , dwight . the grim reaper is here . 
all right . you ready ? here we go ! wow . it ' s a little bit bigger than i remember . come on . we ' re down here . right . 
dwight , they called your name . 
all right . you know what ? okay . no . no problem . you are lucky you have me here . i ' m going to cover for you . [ shouts ] all right ! 
gooood morning , vietnaaaam ! i am not dwight schrute . not at all . i am michael scott , his mentor and boss . and until dwight comes up , if he ever does , i wanted to say a few words about excellence . what makes a work environment excellent ? well , there are many things , i believe , that do such a thing of that nature . and one would be humor . what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman ? 
i ' m very sorry . i did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and i just thought you were speaking abnormally . . . . and now the black guy from the ' police academy ' movies . a robot . [ makes robot sounds ] michael winslow , anyone ? 
car starting . [ makes car sounds ] all right , dwight schrute everyone . 
good luck . that is a tough crowd . 
i got thirsty . how ' d it go ? 
you would not believe what happened here . 
oh ! this woman came in , sat down , ordered a drink . the bartender asked for her id which i thought was odd because i pegged her at like 35 . 
yeah , it was weird . so , she was like ' i don ' t have my id , please give me one . ' and he was like ' i can ' t do that . i can ' t serve you . ' 
she might have been . so she says ' fine . i will go to my room . i will get my purse . i will come back . i ' ll show you my id . ' she hasn ' t come back yet . she ' s probably in her room drinking from the mini - bar ! right ? 
dwight gave a great speech . that ' s the word on the street anyway . and i entertained dwight to no end with my bar stories . so , i captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys . can you believe that ? a thousand guys ? 
that ' s it ? you ' re going to end with " etcetera " ? okay , what ' s this big organizational system that . . . 
that would be suicide . never , never talk specifics . not in a speech . but the fact that you have no idea what to say is , believe it or not , the least of our worries . 
it ' s your delivery . . . 
our biggest worry . 
my god , dwight . the best way to learn is by watching . that ' s why porn is a multi - trillion - dollar industry . listen . okay . sit down , let me wow you . [ clears throat ] [ shouting ] 
see , i have your attention now , don ' t i ? you ' re scared , but now you ' re ready to learn . 
no , it did not . and that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor . we ' ll find you a joke that not even you can ruin . 
all right , listen up , please . dwight has a joke . 
iraq is sand . sailors are on water . 
yeah , well , you know what ? we need to . . . all right , everybody in the conference room now . let ' s go . 
who ' s gonna start . how about phyllis ? you kick us off and then we ' ll move around . go ahead . 
anything your heart desires . 
 [ shouting ] louder ! 
good . good , good , good . that ' s good . now see , that ' s not so hard , right ? all right . who ' s next ? who are we going to . . . ryan . ryan ' s next . 
don ' t be shy , shy boy . don ' t be shy . get up there . 
stop ! stop ! stop ! that ' s , you know what ? the toast is really not supposed to be about anything . it ' s certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else , so . . . 
ryan is a temp , and that means that he could go at any time . am i worried about that ? try scared to death . 
ghosts . lots of ghosts in this old radisson . there it is , rosebud room . memories . wow , this turnout is pathetic . i packed the house , you know . 
numismatic . numismatic collectors . nope , wrong room . 
okay . they got sports medicine seminar , nope . science fiction convention , nope . 
you ' re weird . 
are you a 12 - year - old girl ? i don ' t know . there we go . 
ah , look at me . i ' m huge in wilkes - barre . performing nightly , michael scott . not comedy fans here , which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one . questions ? comment ? can ' t see you , but i know that you ' re not breathing . i know you ' re breathing . is this on ? hello ? " well , isn ' t that . . . well , isn ' t that special ? " " jell - o pudding . " bill cosby . i think bill cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he . . . all the great things they did together as kids . and there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer , and it . . . and he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it . . . he would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn ' t throw it . so . . . bill cosby is smoking ! and now some race car . [ imitating race car engine ] that brings me to my . . . brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients . it ' s important to because a client list is next to godliness . . . list . [ baby crying ] could you shut him up , please ? i mean , who brings a baby to a sales conference ? really rude . 
pam . ms . beasley if yer nastay ! janet jackson . hey ! you having a wardrobe malfunction there ? or w - - -

i am going to give you a little blast from the past of michael gary scott when he was a child star , and a show that you might remember called ' fundle bundle . ' okay ? without further ado , ryan ?

 [ toby knocks on door ] yeah ? 
oh , that ' s okay , she can keep those . 
thank you . 
you have to ask me that because you work for human resources . 
well , sure , playing the field is great , don ' t get me wrong , but there ' s more to life than notches just on my bedpost . 
tell me something honestly , do you . . . think . . . that it is too late for me to have kids ? 
what about . . .

alright , let me explain . again . [ draws on board ] phil has recruited me and another guy . now , we are getting three people each . the more people that get involved , the more who are investing , the more money we ' re all going to make . it ' s not a pyramid scheme , it is a . . . it ' s not even a scheme per se , it ' s . . . [ jim draws a triangle around michael ' s diagram ] . . . i have to go make a call .

when i was seven , my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids . . . and . . . i got a really bad rash from the pony , and all the kids got to ride the pony and i had to go inside , and my mother was rubbing cream on me . . . for probably three hours , and i never came outside . and by the time i got out the pony was already in the truck . and around the corner . so that was my worst birthday . 
 [ eating donuts while dwight plays the recorder ] stop it . stop ! what is that ? 
yeah , well , it ' s on the radio . my birthday blows . nobody even signed my birthday poster . probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything . 
you ' re making it worse . i bet luke perry ' s friends don ' t treat him like this [ points to james dean poster ] .

 [ grinning ] ohhh , god .

when i was sixteen , i was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named julie . but there was another michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with , so she went out with him , on my birthday . and , she got him a cake , at the restaurant . and it wasn ' t even his birthday , but i heard about it the next day in school . so . . . that was the worst birthday i think i ever had .

there you are . good news . did some research . it turns out that 98 % of people with skin cancer fully recover . 
yeah , but it ' s not brain cancer . and it shouldn ' t stop us from having fun . you know what they say the best medicine is . 
and laughter . . . also . 
why are you here ? i didn ' t even invite you to my birthday party . 
 [ mocking voice ] nyeh , i work here . [ to kevin ] alright , well , you know what , since toby doesn ' t speak for everybody and i am your boss , i . . . think you should just go home . take the rest of the afternoon off . take a sick day . 
well , you ' re pretty much driving everyone else here crazy . . . crazy with worry . 
excuse me , everyone . attention please . kevin , we ' re going to take you to a very special place , a place that will make you happy , and a place that is far , far away from the evil sun . 
how dare you sir . you are gross .

hey pam , all this stuff with kevin . . . um , it ' s pretty scary . and i ' m thinking that uh , next time you ' re in the shower , you should check yourself out . you know , give yourself an exam . those things are like ticking time bags . alright ? think about it . 
kevin . you heard anything yet ? 
okay . well . live strong . 
alright .

okay , who ' s this from ? wowwwee , look at that ! jersey ! 
cool . ohh . great . from dwight . 
thank you . . . dwight . that ' s great . thanks . 
yeah . 
oh ! you didn ' t need to do that . . . . nightswept . this is . . . really amazing . thank you . i love it . 
that ' s not how i taught you , right ? [ singing ] my hump , my hump , my lovely lady lump check it out [ dwight imitating drumbeat ] 
okay , here ' s the thing about bosses and employees . a good boss will say , " hey , it ' s my birthday . celebrate me . " a great boss will say , " hey , it ' s my birthday . celebrate yourselves , because you are the ones who made me great , and i will acknowledge your contributions with donuts . " 
good . you know , ryan , you didn ' t have to get me a present . 
good . great . 
no , i think you ' re gonna stay . 
on my 20th birthday , my supposed best friend , sam ambrose , ditched me for his twin sister ' s sweet sixteen party . and that was my worst birthday . until today . 
 [ knock on door ] mmm - hmm . 
oh , good . okay . don ' t tell me , tell them . 
oh , my god . that ' s a piece of cake . that ' s a piece of cake . oh , 2 % . jeez , that ' s good . 
out of , like , 18 billion americans , so , no worry . 
those were probably misdiagnosed . i mean , anybody with a zit goes in and says , " i have cancer . " 
untrue . the heart is bigger than the skin . if you stretched the heart out , it would cover more than the entire body . 
ry , is he bugging you ? dwight , dude , you gotta take a chill pill , man . it was one joint in the parking lot . you know , you ' re totally harshing the office mellow . 
 [ fake coughing ] narc ! 
i wasn ' t attempting to compliment you . 
uuf , well . . . 
 [ shakes head ] okay . . . 
why don ' t you just cool it , cool it dwight , please , god ! [ to jim ] dude , where ' s my office ? [ jim quietly laughs ] i totally lost it , ' cause i was half - baked . smokin ' doobies . doobie brothers , i was smokin ' doobies with my brothers . peace out , seacrest ! 
thanks . m - m - munchies . who wants some munchies ? 
uh - oh . uh - oh . who ' s he calling ? ratting somebody out . narc ! narc ! kevin ? 
remember the narc bit ? [ laughs ] uh - oh , who ' s in trouble ? 
waa . . . what ? what are you talking about ? 
two nights ago , i went to an alicia keys concert at the montage mountain performing arts center . i scored these great aisle seats . anyway , after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and i never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one . i don ' t know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes , and i ' m sure that it was clove cigarettes . everybody in the aisle was doing it . 
okay , attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled . instead , i will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection . 
i can do that , it is my office . 
hmmm . ha . [ under his breath ] alright . great . 
it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about . 
no , uh , no . that was a test . i was testing you , and you all failed . miserably . when i said that dwight was a narc , how many of you defended him ? how many of you said , " hey , you know what , he ' s right ? what he ' s doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs . " 
i am ridiculously anti - drug . so anti - drug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion , or testing of any kind . 
drugs ruin lives people . drugs destroy careers . take cheech and chong everybody knows that cheech and chong are funny , but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn ' t smoke pot . i want everybody to take a look to their left . now i want everybody to take a look to their right . one of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives . this year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children . 
are these facts scaring you , or are they not ? 
do you think that smoking drugs is cool ? do you think that doing alcohol is cool ? 
okay , enough , enough , enough ! i have written down a list of illegal drugs . take a gander . how many of these are you familiar with ? 
yes it is . 
okay , you know what , toby ? pam , can you take this down ? [ pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad ] in addition to toby ' s urine being tested , i would like to test his blood and his hair . 
i can test anyone randomly , and i have chosen you randomly . 
okay , eeny , meenie , miney , moe , is random . okay , you know what ? i ' m going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives , or the lives of a loved one . yeah , pam . 
really ? [ jim shakes his head no ] 
jim it ' s okay . you can t . . . [ jim looks at pam and shakes his head , pam looks at him and gestures for jim to go up and tell his story ] this would be a good place to let it out , jim . these are people you can trust . these are people who care about you . [ jim shakes his head no ] it ' s okay , just we will not judge you . we are here to not judge you . [ jim stands up ] oh , he ' s doing it , okay . [ jim looks at pam ] it ' s okay . [ jim pretends to try , looking teary eyed , shakes his head no , mouths " i can ' t " and sits back down . pam is amazed . ] oh . okay , are you sure ? [ jim shakes his head . kevin pats his shoulder ] that looked like it was going to be good . alright . [ pam nods in admiration at jim ] okay , well . 
the point i ' m trying to make with all of this people is that i hate drugs . i hate them , and based upon what i have seen you all don ' t quite hate ' em as much as i do so you are going to have a drug test , and i am not . 
yes , i will not be . 
okay , well dwight just know that i ' ve been very busy today and i got a lot of work to do and i wasn ' t planning on going to the bathroom and i don ' t even know if anything is going to come out , okay ? so good . thank you . 
so i need you to do some work on the st . andrews account . i need your urine . i need some filing done . 
just forget it . just the urine . 
just . i need your urine . 
yes in a cup , we ' re not animals , dwight . 
it ' s none of your business . 
okay . alright . just , i went to an alicia keys concert , over the weekend , and i think i may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring . 
i need clean urine for the lady . 
don ' t think of it that way . it ' s like , urine goes all over the place . you know , there ' s no controlling it . it just . . . goes 
a cup could find its way under the urine . it might be an accident . it happens . 
no , just look . look . just . . . just fill up the cup . 
dwight . well , i passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee . thank you very much . 
what ' s wrong ? where ' s your costume ? 
why ? wha . . . 
since you did such a good job with the investigation , i decided to pull a few strings . call in a few favors . and i ' ve decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch . 
yes , sir . 
so you wanna ? thanks . 
okay . 
good . 
no . oh . uh . . . [ awkwardly salutes ] 
alright . [ to hank ] well , thank you . 
drugs are everywhere in our society . they are omniscient . if you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the united states last year , that would reach the moon . 
exactly . i know . it ' s amazing . 
shut . . . shut it . no . just . . . just focus on the facts . cocaine . they use cocaine . 
one thing that you need to remember is that there ' s no way of knowing who ' s a user , who ' s an abuser , because we don ' t know . it could be anybody . your instinct is to say it ' s somebody - like stanley or oscar . . . 
no , no ! your instinct . that . . . your gut reaction is to say that , but i don ' t ! that ' s , that ' s . . . those are instincts that have been created by media and hype . and they are wrong . what i am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are . it may be the person you least suspect . it may be somebody hot , like pam , or it could be somebody matronly , like phyllis , but just not me . 
no ? okay , fine . 
okay , well , i really think that . . . [ dial tone beeping ] 
yeah . sorry you had to hear that . it was a lovers ' quarrel . 
okay , let ' s get personal for a second , shall we ? 
okay , well , i made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out , in case you ' re ever tempted . so there you go . and , dwight , you know , i ' m very busy today . it wasn ' t even planning on going to the bathroom , so i don ' t even know if anything will come out . 
well . . . 
i don ' t . . . let ' s just not talk about it , okay ? 
yes , thanks , fantastic sam ' s . adult cut plus . comes with a shampoo and blow dry . we ' re doing i . d . photos today . gotta represent . 
that ' s a nice tie . 
that is . . . who makes that ? 
do you mind if i wear that for the photo ? 
 [ walking into the conference room ] what ' s the dealio ? 
what ' s the problem ? 
so what , you ' re having a little spat . i forget , are you guys dating ? 
yes . 
yeah ? 
okay . 
what do you know about conflict resolution ? your answer to everything is to get divorced . so . . . 
okay . . . what ? 
yeah , well . . . that ' s not gonna fly here . because in this office , it is till death do us part . . . assuming we don ' t get downsized . [ leans over to pam ] uh , pam , will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please ? 
 [ holding up a binder ] a mediator ' s tool chest . okay , well , before we get started , you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict . [ in a comedic voice ] my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style . 
no . okay , this is important . the first style is lose / lose . 
just hold on , please ! okay , if we do lose / lose , neither of you gets what you want . do you understand ? you . . . you would both lose . now i need to ask you , do you want to pursue a lose / lose negotiation ? 
win / win is number four and number five is win / win / win . the important difference here is with win / win / win , we all win . me too . i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work . 
 [ in front of poster ] okay , since this is the disputed poster . now , one at a time , i want you to express your feelings using " i " emotion language and no judging or " you " statements . 
come on , seriously , that ? 
okay , okay . stop , stop , stop ! let ' s see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win / win . 
yes . thank you , pam . how about angela makes the poster into a t - shirt , which oscar wears . that way , he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar , she can see it . win / win / win . 
okay . . . well , brainstorm . own the solution . 
okay , that is called a compromise . and it is style 3 . and it is not ideal . to sum up , win / win - make the poster into a t - shirt , win / lose - take the poster down , compromise - tuesdays and thursdays . and the answer is . . . make the poster into a t - shirt ! win / win . 
 [ claps his hands twice ] it is done ! 
yes . 
are those all the other complains ? 
i would like to see those please . 
you can ' t do that , huh ? huh , ok . now you and i have a conflict . i order you to give me that file . 
okay . [ yanks the file away , despite toby ' s resistance ] there ! no more conflict . [ looks at the camera ] i had to use win / lose on that . it was not pretty . [ looks back at toby ] all right . . . is that it ? 
ohh . . . god . alright . why do i have to do everything ? 
 [ looking through papers in the complaint box ] this is from kevin . he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking . meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright . creed . . . huh . duh , duh . creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist . 
you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me . 
how many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain about another employee ? [ looks at all the employees , most of whom raise their hands ] and . . . did you get what you wanted , or were you merely listened to , you forget about your problem , and you move on ? [ employees mumble " merely listen to and forgotten . . . " ] that is outrageous ! i love this place . . . and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering . . . [ sighs ] okay , today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open , where it can be resolved . alright , how about the phyllis / angela dispute ? 
that ' s what she said . [ jim mouths these words along with michael ] the thing is , angela . . . you are in here an awful lot . you have complained about everybody in the office , except dwight , which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight . toby , by the way , what does " redacted " mean ? there is a file full of complaints in here marked " redacted " . . . ? 
oh , ok . there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago . 
all right , pamela . come on down ! let ' s do it ! and [ looks through the file ] . . . okay . just one complaint . actually , it has been withdrawn . so that is no help to us . next . 
uh . . . [ reading ] " does she have to plan her wedding on office time ? couldn ' t she do that at home ? " [ pam looks angela an angry look ] who else ? why don ' t we just warm up first ? warm up emotionally , all right ? 
here is a kelly complaint : " ryan never returns my calls . " ugh , join the club . 
 [ crumbles up the complaint paper ] makin ' progress . [ jim raises his hand ] yes ? 
what ? ! 
stanley . [ off camera ] 
 [ still of camera ] you got a lot of anger under there buddy . come on start us out . unleash it . 
someone complained that the men ' s room is " whites only " . stanley , you know that ' s not true . 
okay , phyllis . you complained that angela ' s giving you dirty looks . and you tried to get off the party planning committee . 
and . . . also , phyllis , stanley says that you cry too much , and that bugs him . 
oh . . . ok . 
okay , well . . . all settled , then . 
ok , ryan . you told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell ? 
all right , kevin . you are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable . solution : angela , you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to kevin that will make him uncomfortable . 
uh . dwight . 
okay ! calm down . 
hey , hey ! 
stop . 
okay . . . 
dwight . . . 
stop . . . 
oh . . . kay . . . 
okay . 
yes . 
mm - hmm . 
 [ picks up dwight ' s i . d . and snickers ] you know your i . d . says you ' re a security threat ? 
okay . . . you two , in the conference room with me . nobody leaves until we work this out . cage match ! 
cage matches ? yeah , they work . how could they not work ? if they didn ' t work , everybody would still be in the cage . 
okay , so dwight , in your own words - [ reads from complaint paper ] " someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons . i suspect jim halpert . " [ flips to another paper ] " everyone has called me ' dwayne ' all day . i think jim halpert paid them to . " 
 [ reading ] " this morning , i found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and jim halpert tried to convince me i committed murder . i think he may be the real murderer . " [ flips to another paper ] " jim halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman ' s room . when i went to save the child , i saw meredith on the can . " gah . " this morning , i knocked myself in the head with the phone . " 
 [ reading ] " every time i typed my name , it said ' diapers ' . " 
 " by the end of the day , my desk was about two feet closer to the copier . " 
the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage , where they dig into your body , very hard . and it is very painful . and apparently , some people throw up . but the next day they feel great . i ' ve never had one . they sound awful . 
hey , there ' s like , 300 more of these . let ' s get to them later . 
maybe , i haven ' t decided yet . let ' s get to work . 
okay . oh . . . actually , tomorrow ' s not good . how about later in the week ? 
good . okay . 
hey ! wait . how about a group picture while you ' re here ? 
well . . . that ' s . . . what , a computer camera , right ? 
it ' ll take like two seconds . 
ugh . . . all right . everybody , [ looks around at the employees ] come on . group photo for the newsletter . 
come on , everybody . 
we resolved a lot today , everybody . think happy thoughts . 
good , let ' s check that out . [ looks at preview screen ] ew , okay , all right . one more . we ' ll take one more . 
what ? 
 [ off camera ] you just press the button . 
 [ off camera ] okay , good . check that out . 
 [ off camera ] that ' s terrible . 
 [ off camera ] let ' s pay mr . price gouger . [ rejoins the group , on camera ] okay . . . we can do this . come on , everybody . all right . here we go . [ flash goes off before he sits down ] 
it was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people . he would not give me a good discount . and eight tries added up . 
 [ flashback the photo being taken ] one , two . . [ flash goes off ] didn ' t say three , did i ? 
but , i ' m sort of an expert at photoshop , so it turned out fine in the end . when people work together , there is going to be conflict . you can ' t outrun your problems . 
and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing . but here ' s the thing about cage matches : sometimes you have to open the cage . and that is something toby will never understand . 
nothing much is happening today . we are having our photo ids taken . whoop - de - doo . can ' t always be like the apprentice . 
on big brother , something important happens every day . but real life is not like that . 
i hate it when people don ' t tell each other why they ' re angry . my dad was like that . i would say , " what ' s wrong , dad ? what ' s wrong , dad ? what ' s wrong , dad ? what ' s wrong , dad ? what ' s wrong , dad ? what ' s wrong , dad ? " over and over and over . and he would just look at me like i was an idiot . 
there is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby . and they can ' t decide , so they bring the baby to a wise man . just like a manager in those days . and the wise man says , " i will adopt this baby and raise it as a hindu . " see ? they didn ' t expect that . and that fixed it . because i think he was the dad anyway . 
there are dozens of old complaints in here . cold cases , like the show . [ imitating gonging ] and toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder / suicides are not important enough to solve . well , you know what ? i have a problem with that . and i ' m going to open up these cases before toby can kill or rape another person . 
wow ! i never thought dwight would go postal . it ' s always the person you least expect and i always thought dwight would go postal . 
 " cage match " ? i don ' t know if it was in the packet from corporate , because i barely read any of it . so if you ' re asking if i stole their idea , the answer is no . 
tonight the scranton business park is having casino night and we are converting our warehouse into a full - blown gambling hall . and i know it ' s illegal in pennsylvania , but it ' s for charity . and i consider myself a great philanderer . it ' s just . . . it ' s nice to know at the end of the day , i can look in the mirror and say , " michael , because of you , some little kid in the congo has a belly full of rice this evening . " makes you feel good . 
i try not to think of it as lagging behind . it ' s more of a david - and - goliath thing . 
top 80 percent ! 
yeah ? 
jan , listen , i promise that i will kick it up a notch . bam ! 
emeril . oh , actually , while i have you , not that i have you or have ever had you , but we ' re having our casino night tonight and i think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here . 
i am , but you are the eva peron to my cesar chavez . 
oh , come on . come on . 
you know , it ' d be fun . i can hear it in your voice . you need a break . 
jan and i understand each other . the romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being , but we ' ve remained good friends . good friends with privileges . not now , some day . 
okay , everybody . tonight ' s event is to benefit the boy scouts of america . 
well , they need our money . they don ' t have cookies like the girl scouts . 
well , oscar , if you don ' t like it , then you should concentrate on winning . because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $ 500 to donate to the charity of their choice . and they will get a mini - fridge compliments of vance refrigeration . 
so get your charities in to pam . i , for example , am playing for comic relief . 
comedy is very much alive , as are homeless people . 
well , then , they need our money more than ever . 
oh , and another fun thing . we , at the end of the night , are going to give the check to an actual group of boy scouts . right , toby ? we ' re gonna . . . 
why are you the way that you are ? honestly , every time i try to do something fun or exciting , you make it not . . . that way . i hate so much about the things that you choose to be . okay , you know what ? i will not donate my winnings to comic relief , since apparently it doesn ' t exist . i am going to donate to afghanistanis with aids . 
no , i mean afghanistanis with aids . 
what ? 
that ' s a dog . 
that ' s a shawl . 
no . humans with aids . 
okay , you know what ? no . no . aids is not funny . believe me , i have tried . 
there are certain topics that are off - limits to comedians , jfk , aids , the holocaust . the lincoln assassination just recently became funny . " i need to see this play like i need a hole in the head . " [ laughs ] and i hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious aids joke . it ' s one of my dreams . 
i have already put down the deposit . do you understand how a deposit works ? 
it ' s casino night like las vegas . there are fire - eaters all over the place . 
well , actually , it ' s my warehouse . 
why are you here ? 
not . i said , not that . 
that ' s ironic . 
that you are afraid . 
dinkin ' flicka . 
give me some . [ michael and darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture ] 
 [ phone rings ] yes 
who ? 
do i know a carol stills ? 
oh , yeah , put her through . hey carol , how goes the real estate biz ? is it real good ? 
hi , carol . how you doing ? 
oh , hey , no problemo . incidentally , i love the place . 
great . it has a little bit of a weird smell . it ' s okay . at christmas , the tree helped . 
actually , i ' m sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse , casino night . 
yeah , it ' ll be good . you know what ? why don ' t you come by ? bring the papers , i ' ll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink . 
yeah . it ' ll be fun . what do you . . . [ phone rings ] what do you . . . 
oh , i ' m sorry . could you hold on ? yes ? 
okay , put her through . [ deep voice ] jan levinson , i presume ? 
hey , jan . how you doing ? 
i am ? 
oh , okay .

two queens on casino night . i am going to drop a deuce on everybody . 
hey , hey .

okay . 
billy , your nurse is hot . 
your nurse became your girlfriend ? sweet . 
chili ' s is great . 
welkommen , bienvenue , and welcome to monte carlo ! dwight . i am no longer your boss . lady fortune is your boss . 
shut it , shut it , shut it . will lady fortune be your mistress ? only time will tell , my friends . leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door . old friends , new lovers , and the disabled ! welcome all ! great , okay . shuffle up and deal . let ' s get it started ! black - eyed crows . 
all - in . [ other players fold their hands ] 
bluffing is a key part of poker , which is too bad , because i ' m not very good at bluffing . did you believe me ? 
what are . . . that ' s insane . 
well , toby , i went all - in on the first hand , so doesn ' t that tell you that i might have good cards , too ? so don ' t be stupid . just take it back . 
okay , all right , whatever . 
you really screwed that up . [ michael leaves ] 
yeah , whatever . hey , you know what ? if luck weren ' t involved , i would always be winning . [ sees jan ] oh , my god . oh , my god . 
jan . 
look , okay , i think we ' re all adults here , and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship . 
after you said you weren ' t coming , i invited carol to come and i don ' t think that i did anything wrong . 
um . . . 
hey . what . . . 
all right ! 
four ! [ holds dice in front of carol ] blow . blow for luck ! yeah ! also , you . not playing favorites . [ holds dice in front of jan ] all right , here we go ! 
yeah ! 
so close . so close . 
hey , okay . 
thank you . 
okay . thanks for coming . 
okay . talk to you monday . 
good night . she ' s a good boss . 
oh , she ' s great . 
love triangle . drama . all worked out in the end , though . the hero got the girl . who saw that coming ? i did . and jan was really happy for me . so actually the hero got two girls . he got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from . so , i ' ve got my new york girl and my local flavor . life is good . 
everybody , in the conference room now , please . thank you . time is money . 
no . 
no . 
i want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors . 
good . yes , that will work . all right . now i need a plural noun . [ all groaning ] 
how about a location ? 
where the hell is that ? 
okay , all right . 
no , no , no . no , no , not until you give me an adjective . 
we already have that . so . . . 
no , toby , damn it , come on ! we already have that . i need something fun . something like fat or smelly . or pukey . pukey . pukey ' s good . okay . pukey . now i need a noun . 
good . thank you , phyllis . that wasn ' t so hard . all right , here we go . " office depot is an annoying store . one day creed went there to buy paper . and he ran into irritating cylons . " 
 " one of them was named michael scott , and he was an . . . " oh , damn it . okay . okay , okay , we ' re . . . okay , we ' re starting over . 
look , if anything goes missing , we will reimburse . 
dang ! paper making paper , i . e . money . 
paper money . [ clears throat ] yeah . the company ' s doing fine . 
hey . okay . you know what ? don ' t even think . i command you to just go down and have fun tonight . all right ? don ' t think about it . 
our numbers are down , yes , but we have a heck of a crew here in scranton . hardworking , motivated , dynamic . every single last one of them . they follow my lead . i sort of set the tone . and it doesn ' t hurt that my ex works for corporate . jan loves this branch , and i think that ' s really more than half the battle . 
no ! that is the fun of this place . i call everybody " faggie " . why would anybody find that offensive ? 
that ' s what faggie means ! 
it wasn ' t just an action movie , it was die hard ! 
exactly ! 
yeah , i know . 
ok , a little too far , crossed the line . 
i would have never called him that if i knew . you don ' t . . . you don ' t call retarded people " retards " . it ' s bad taste . you call your friends " retards " when they ' re acting retarded . and i consider oscar a friend . 
listen man , i am so sorry . i had no idea . 
no . no it ' s not . i feel terrible about it . i have been calling people " faggie " since i was in junior high , and i have never made this mistake . if i don ' t know how to behave , it is because i am just so far the opposite way , you know ? i ' m just . . . i , i can ' t even imagine . . . the . . . thing . maybe we could go out for a beer sometime . and you could tell me . . . how . . . you do that to another dude . 
can you tell who ' s gay and who ' s not ? 
what about oscar ? 
well , he is . 
 [ deep sigh ] there could be others . . . i need to know . i don ' t want to offend anybody else . 
yeah , i ' m sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay . 
hey , what about angela ? she ' s hard and severe . she could be a gay woman . 
i don ' t know , i can imagine her with another woman , can ' t you ? 
do some research . find out if there ' s a way to tell by just looking at them . 
that ' s ridiculous . 
 [ sighs ] let ' s call him and get the website . 
well , they ' re sold out . 
i watch the l word . i watch , queer as f * * * , so . . . 
what ? what does that even . . . 
well , gay pride , right ? gay pride parade ? it ' s not like gay . . . shame festival . 
i think angela might be gay . could oscar and angela be having a gay affair ? maybe ! is that what this is about ? 
i don ' t kn - - 
anything ' s possible . 
 [ laughs ] well , i ' m not gay jan , and you should know that better than anybody ! 
the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100 , 000 years of being weirded out by gays . 
trick question ! cause you can ' t always tell , so . . . how would i know . is that the right answer ? 
 [ looking at gay porn ] nothing wrong with this stuff . at all . this is fine . you know what . gay porn , straight porn , it ' s all goooooood ! i don ' t particularly get into this . but uh , you know what . i totally see the merit ! and actually . . . it is quite beautiful . 
 [ yelling ] all right , everybody in the conference room ! i don ' t care if you are gay , or straight , or a lesbian , or overweight ! just get in here ! right now ! 
did you know that gay used to mean happy ? when i was growing up it meant lame . and now it means a man , who makes love . . . to other men . 
we ' re all homos ! homosapiens . gays aren ' t necessarily who you think they are , people . i mean anybody could be gay . business - men . like antique dealers , or hairdressers , or . . . accountants . oscar , why don ' t you take this opportunity to officially come out , to everybody here . however you want to do it . go ahead . stand up . i ' m doing this for you . 
who should be the judges and juries of our society ? 
yes , that ' s a good point . she has a good point . because gay marriage currently is not legal , under u . s . law . i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them . so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could . you know ? sounds pretty good , right ? 
that ' s great . congratulations phyllis . that is great , and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing ! [ laughs ] see ? everybody has a chance ! 
but still , phyllis , in college ? did you ever experiment with other women ? a lot of women do ! 
 [ laughing ] right ! [ serious ] and i take that as a compliment . 
well , i just like to look good ok , so - - - 
no , i am just coming out myself . i am coming out hetero ! 
no no no . the only signal that i am sending is : gay , good . 
look , if i was gay , i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen . i would be leading the parade covered in feathers , and just . . . i would be waving that rainbow flag . 
you misunderstand - - ok . you know what , ok . i uh , i ' m gonna put my money where my mouth is . you ready ? i am going to embrace oscar . you might want to watch this angela , because you can ' t catch anything . here we go . we are going to make a statement . you and i are going to make a statement together . oscar is my friend - - - 
 . . . and i just don ' t care who sees it , doesn ' t bother me ! 
all right , um . . . sorry . 
 [ sobbing ] i ' m sorry i called you faggie . you ' re not faggie . you ' re a a good guy . 
 [ embracing oscar ] you know what , i ' m going to raise the stakes . i want you to watch this . and i want you to burn this into your brains . because this is an image that i want you people to remember for a long time to come . whenever you come into the office i want you to think about this . [ awkwardly kissing oscar ] i did it . see . i ' m still here . we ' re all still here . [ everyone claps ] 
 [ dwight gets up to kiss oscar ] oh come on ! dwight ! come on , man ! 
we are not in the playground anymore . there are new rules . we have to be mature . but we can ' t lose the spirit of child like wonder . what is love . . . anyway ? maybe it ' s supposed to break all the rules . like me and jan . or oscar . . . and some guy . life is short . when two people find each other , what should stand in their way ? 
i am glad that today spurred social change . that ' s part of my job as regional manager . but you know what ? even if it didn ' t , at least we put this matter to bed . . . . that ' s what she said . or he said . 
oh , there ' s gill . oscar ' s roommate . i wonder if he knows ? 
i will do my job to the best of my abilities . 
i will do my regional manager job to the best of my capability . 
specifically , jan , i will make at least ten phone calls to clients . 
yes , i have to begin every day by letting jan know what i intend to accomplish , and then i have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what i did accomplish . but it ' s not mandatory . it ' s something that i . . . wanted to do . . . and so it ' s voluntary , really . even though she . . . makes me . i think she just wants to hear my voice . because we ' re no longer lovers , and she ' s just hurting . but things are going well with carol . i ' ve seen her seven times in the last few months , and i ' m growing very fond of her kids . tommy , who i call tomas , and the little girl . . . 
 [ quietly ] no . 
okay . [ jan hangs up . toby opens the office door . ] 
 [ sigh ] 
hi , honey . you holding up ? 
yeah . 
oh , good . by yourself ? 
aw . well , hang in there , okay ? you know what ? you should get one of this big body pillows . that way you wouldn ' t miss you - know - who so much . 
roy . 
pam ? 
did you see oprah yesterday ? 
i , uh . . . i am going to be a father . 
angelina jolie was on . and she adopted a baby from asia , and she said that it changed her life . and that really inspired me . so , i want you to look into seeing how much a little chinese baby would cost . 
i know . 
well . . . 
just do it , okay ? 
um . . . find out if there ' s a cheaper , less expensive baby out there , okay ? 
eight months ? 
i don ' t even know if i ' ll want a baby in eight months . 
you know what , pam ? if in ten years , i haven ' t had a baby , and you haven ' t had a baby . . . 
twenty years . 
thirty . 
it ' s a deal . 
yesh . 
right there . ah . 
per diem . 
guess where i am going . i will give you a hint . it is a booze - fueled sex romp , where anything goes . you are correct , sir ! i am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern mid - market office supply convention . and jim halpert is going to be coming , which will be fun . poor little guy . he ' s been stuck working under josh , the poor man ' s michael scott , as he is known around my condo . 
sleep with who ? whom , whom . . . whom ? 
oh , wow ! oh my god , i have a great idea . you know what you should do to be hilarious ? wear your wedding dress . it would be a great icebreaker . 
yeah , do it ! 
really ? okay . well , word of advice : unbutton that top button . let those things breathe . any message you want me to relate to jim ? 
um . okay , um . 
you got that ?

um . 
hey , josh , how ya doing ? 
good to see you . there he is ! there ' s the traitor ! traitor ! traitor ! come here , you . come here ! yeah ! the product . . . the progidal . . . my son returns . 
i was shocked when he told me he was transferring to stamford . it ' s like the firemen . you don ' t leave your brothers behind , even if you find out that there is a better fire in connecticut . 
yeah ! wow , i didn ' t expect that . it ' s good to see you too ! 
hey ! 
ah . 
jan ? look , i think we need to set some ground rules . 
the eight - hundred pound gorilla in the room . carol . i ' m still dating her , so nothing can happen between us at the convention . 
thank you for being so brave with all of this . thank you . 
i know ! that is specifically why i chose a room close to the elevator . more foot traffic . 
that is crooked on that side . 
hey hey ! 
yeah . 
well , that ' s how we do it in scranton . or did you forget ? there ain ' t no party like a scranton party , ' cause a scranton party don ' t stop . 
hey , well , we have time ! one for the road , gentlemen ? 
wish i was . i love inside jokes . i ' d love to be a part of one someday . 
all right , see you guys down there . change your mind , come back up . 
ugh , that would be gross . it ' s not even lunch yet . 
swag ! stuff we all get . i basically decorated my condo for free with all of my swag . 
check it out . hi , i ' m michael scott , dunder - mifflin . 
you know what ? i ' m having a huge blowout tonight , room 308 . hope you can come . 
well , cool ! okay , so . . . can i tell people you ' re gonna be there ? 
so maybe . see ya . 
because he ' s afraid to fly . 
do you remember me from last year ? there ' s a party in my room , 308 , can ' t miss it , right off the elevator . tonight . be there ! 
yep . yeah , she ' s up front . 
i don ' t have to , i just know . yes , hello ? 
 [ into phone ] see you in a bit . bye - bye . [ to dwight ] may i have a moment of your time please ? 
i need you to do something for me . 
i want you to dig up some dirt on josh . find out if there are any skeletons in his attic . 
and ? 
business has been pretty crazy around the office . 
yeah . moved ryan over to your desk . 
i will call him later with that message . 
toby flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry . is he why you left ? 
opportunity , promotion , blah , blah . you know , jim , those are just words . have you taken into account other factors , vis - a - vis bosses ? is josh funnier than i am ? does he even have a girlfriend ? because i have two , basically . 
hey , jan , jan ? don ' t worry , i have got the tip . 
you ' re welcome . 
no , that was a different hundred dollar bill . 
i have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening . 
the party i ' m having tonight in 308 . obviously , you are invited . 
any messages for 308 ? all right . 
hey hey , fellers . 
what ' s up ? 
hey , check this out . how about that ? a little friendly competition . stamford versus scranton . 
oh , jim . looks like you picked a bad time to defect , my friend . 
okay ! excellent . oh . . . 
shut it . [ answering phone ] hey , pam , what ' s up ? yep , yech . . . no . tell him i will give him general specifics tomorrow , okay ? yes . [ to others ] say hi to pam ! 
yes . that is josh and dwight and jim . [ to others ] pam says hi . [ into phone ] have fun on your date ! very good , talk to you later . bye . 
you first . 
not . it hit the rim . okay , and . . . okay . double or nothing . 
well , let ' s . . . 
come on ! 
come on ! 
fine . 
jim and i have different definitions of friendship . i think it ' s talking and being friends , and jim thinks it ' s moving to connecticut and being best friends with josh . well , phooey on that . i , uh , i ' m done . i am not going to be speaking with him anymore . whatevs . long - distance relationships never work . 
okay , let me tell you what we ' re looking for . 
sorry , my meeting ran late . 
yes , jan , really . with a rep from hammermill . 
used to be . evan will call you in the morning to work out the details . we can now sell hammermill products . 
yeah , well , maybe next time you will estimate me . 
hey , first guest ! you are going to have some tequila , my friend . 
this is the party . 
party central ! so , what can i do you for ? [ guy leaves ] all right . 
people have been filtering in and out . 
what ? 
sure . you like cosmos ? 
sure , sounds good . so why are you here ? is josh busy ? 
i get it ! no , no , i totally get it . he made a better paper airplane , stamford is better in sales . . . i get it . we had some fun . we had some laughs . and that ' s just . . . 
i ' m not better than josh . 
oh my god . you don ' t even know . she ' s single now . 
i ' m sorry , man . i ' m sorry . hey , you know what ? i will talk to her . 
yeah . 
i will . i ' ll talk to her . you should at least talk to roy . i mean , he knows exactly how you ' re feeling . 
hey ! no , you know , people have been filtering in and out . 
evan , this is jim . 
hey , ernie , how ya doing ? 
best friends . 
some people need dozens of friends to say , " hey , look at me , i ' m popular . " but not me . i ' m very picky . i need three , maybe two . when you meet that someone special , you ' ll just know . because a real relationship , it . . . it can ' t be forced . it should just come about effortlessly . 
now , would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights , sir ? [ lights go out , leaving michael ' s black light on ] ha , ha , ha . 
whoa . what are those stains ? 
oh , god , i hope it ' s urine . 
today i ' m headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern office supply convention . [ makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream ] wooo - yaaaaah ! oh , these things tend to be kind of crazy . 
 [ angela enters michael ' s office ] ah . 
per - diem . [ singing as he signs ] perrrr - diiiiieeeemmmm ! [ shows off $ 100 bill to ryan ] you know , ryan , it ' s all about the benjamins . 
 [ points to door ] right there . 
yes . what ? oh , yeah , have pam give those to me . 
sure you don ' t want to come ? 
gonna be fun ! change your mind we can get you a cot . 
a couple of years ago , i went to one in hartford . " connecticut . " and todd packer and i went to this bar and met a girl . and [ laugh ] packer decides to make out with her . turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar . [ laugh ] i love this . the bouncer chases us out to packer ' s vette , jump in the vette , he peels out , and i [ laugh ] i don ' t make it to the car . [ turns serious ] um , and the other bouncers caught up with me and really did a number on me . . . it was in the paper . . . [ brightens ] but to answer your question , yeah , i ' m really excited about this weekend . 
see that factory ? 
i almost worked there . 
yup . yeah , i applied for a job there . 
i was going to be a bottle capper . 
i know , i know . crazy world . crazy , crazy world . 
josh reminds me of a guy i went to high school with . big football star , girls loved him . whatever . guess what he ' s doing now . he ' s a tv announcer for the eagles . up in the . . . [ laughs ] he doesn ' t even get to play in the game , i mean . 
 [ waiting on pam to be done with the microwave ] ahhhhhhhhh . [ whispering loudly ] i ' m hungry . 
movie monday ! the only cure i know for the monday blues is . . . varsity blues ! 
let ' s gooooo ! let ' s go , let ' s go , let ' s go ! 
alright , everybody here ? yes . 
yes pleeeeease ! thank yooouuu ! 
entourage ! 
kevin , would you like to do the scenes from last week ? 
don ' t whine . get the window . [ dwight exhales ] 
previously on varsity blues . . . 
 [ jan walks in on movie monday ] hi jan ! hope you brought the milk duds ! 
people work faster after . . . 
no . . . they have to . . . to make up for the time they lost watching the movie . 
ok . 
ouchy . 
three hours , wow . have fun . [ dwight walks away staring through the blinds at michael ] 
hi . 
oh . that ' s nice . 
 . . . what ? 
 . . . you were at the dentist ? 
ok . 
what was dwight thinking ? that he could turn jan against me ? she ' s my ex - lover ! . . . ish . 
hey dwight . 
do you want an m & amp ; m ? 
no seriously . you should have an m & amp ; m , they ' re really good . 
they ' re good , huh ? 
hey . i thought you weren ' t supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you ' ve had a crown put in . 
sounds like a good dentist . 
what ' s his name ? 
your dentist ' s name is crentist . 
huh . sounds a lot like dentist . 
let me see your teeth . let me see ' em . let me see ' em . 
you should . . . floss . 
 [ exhales ] well then . . . i am glad you ' re ok . 
business is like a jungle . and i . . . am like a tiger . and dwight , is like a monkey , that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick . does the tiger fire the monkey ? does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch ? [ smiling ] pun . there is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger ' s head . we don ' t have the technology . 
dwight , can i talk to you for a second ? 
 [ in michael ' s office ] wow , this is tough . 
ohhhh . arrrgggh ! 
well , i just got off the phone with jan . and um . . . she demoted me . 
yeah . you know what the craziest part of this is ? she demoted me to your job ! 
and she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate , and that um , i guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of dunder mifflin , scranton . 
i know . i told her i didn ' t know whether you ' d wanna do it . . . because you ' ve always been so loyal to me . you ' ve been my most trusted ally . 
yep , i did . i did . but i think . . . you should do it . 
 [ exhales ] perfect , well , we ' re settled . 
all right . well then , you are now acting manager of dunder mifflin scranton branch , and i . . . am assistant regional manager . 
ohh . . 
 [ muttering ] can ' t you ? that ' s so nice . 
well . . . i guess we should go tell the troops . 
hey , hi , hello . everybody , i have some good news , and i have some bad news . i . . . am being replaced , as your leader , by dwight . 
you might think that i am kidding , and i understand that . 
because , dwight . . . never lies . 
because that ' s all it takes . 
ok , dwight , would you like to say a few words to everybody . . . about loyalty ? 
oh , i ' ll be fine . 
no , no , i don ' t , but - - - 
i . . . won ' t . i won ' t . 
well , i guess it ' s time , that i turn over the keys , to the famous sebring . 
it ' s a corporate lease dwight , you ' ve earned it . 
what ? 
but you said you liked it . you ' ve always admired it . 
 [ michael finally breaks ] take it back . 
that ' s my car . 
that ' s my car . 
i know , dwight . i know . i know . i know . 
jan called me about your little meeting ! 
i know , what you did . i made the whole thing up , dwight . 
oh do you ? do you like the sebring - - - how dare you ? ! how dare you , dwight ? 
give me one good reason why i should fire you right here on the spot ? ! 
not . good . enough ! 
i have a laundry machine ! 
i don ' t know if i can trust you anymore . 
you can get up . get up . [ dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips ] and you can hug it out , bitch . [ dwight and michael have a firm embrace ] 
hug it out , bitch . that is what men say to each other , after a fight . they hug it out , and doing so , the just . . . let it go . and walk away . and they ' re done . not a good idea to say that to a woman however . i have found . it doesn ' t translate . 
yep . yeah , we hugged it out . but , it turns out , i was still a little angry . so , i felt i needed to punish him , just a little bit more , [ cut to dwight standing on a box with " liar " written on a piece of paper hung around his neck , dwight ' s head hung in shame ] and i ' m making him do my laundry for a year . 
okay . [ jan leaves michael ' s office ; dwight enters ] 
it is not your business , dwight . 
what do you know about management , dwight ? 
i ' m not firing anyone . 
 . . . what ? 
okay . here we go . everybody , you know what ? it dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted , let ' s get back in there . [ no takers ] come on . movie monday ! come on , stanley let ' s go . 
ryan ? 
okay , well , we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together , so i guess i will just go play some online scrabble . 
so , she sleeps with him , but she is still in love with the head surgeon , um , the mcdreamy guy , and she starts crying , but the dorky doctor , he ' s in love with her . . . [ phone rings ] 
really ? 
hey ryan , can i get you a pencil from the warehouse ? 
oh , it ' s okay , i ' m going down . 
all right , i ' ll be right back . [ goes down pretend stairs ] 
 [ hands ryan pencil ] there you go . 
you ' re welcome . 
don ' t mind if i do . see you in a minute . [ goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from stanley ' s desk ] 
there you go , fresh from the warehouse . 
there ' s coffee in the kitchen , pam . 
 [ breathless ] all right . okay . [ goes back down pretend stairs , crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee ] 
i am like bette midler in for the boys . gotta keep the troops entertained . 
 [ sighs ] all right . 
oookay . let me see if i have his cell . is this the only reason you are calling , jan ? or does somebody miss me ? 
oh , wow . 
attention , everybody . i just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that i should know first . my old boss ed truck has died . 
yes , i am . it ' s very sad . because he was my boss . 
that ' s right , you worked with him . so did creed . well , i ' ll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by . cheer me up . 
so did you hear the news ? 
yeah . 
oh , gosh , what can anybody do , really ? it ' s . . . pssssh . . . . he was almost 70 . circle of life . 
 [ holds out arms to pam ] 
yeah . mmmmmm . 
yeah . must really have you thinkin ' . 
the older you get , the bigger the chance is you ' re gonna die . you knew that . 
what ? 
oh my god . 
that is just not the way a dunder mifflin manager should go , i ' m sorry . alone , out of the blue , and not even have his own head to comfort him . 
 [ clears throat ] so , i ' m not exactly sure how to say this . . . 
what are you doing ? 
i didn ' t . . . he was driving on the road and he went under a truck . and that ' s when his head was separated from the rest of him . and i will let you know more as soon as i find out . 
i don ' t understand . we have a day honoring martin luther king , but he didn ' t even work here . 
you really don ' t get it , do you ? you don ' t understand these people . that is the last thing that they would want is a day off . 
 [ thoughtfully ] a statue . 
yeah . 
well , i think it would be very realistic , it would look just like him . 
we could have his eyes light up , we could have his arms move . . . 
i think that is a great way to honor ed . 
life - size . 
well , we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company , jan . 
mm hm . 
oh do you ? you know who wished they could get back to work is ed truck . 
but ed truck can ' t because he is - - - 
dead . 
that ' s perfect . 
oohh . . . can you imagine how much blood there was ? if it happened right here , it would reach all the way to reception . probably get on pam . 
what ? 
well , you know what ? i didn ' t wanna hear about it either , stanley , but i did and now i can ' t stop picturing it . he leaves work , he ' s on his way home . . . wham ! his cappa is detated from his head ! 
well , you know what ? there ' s something wrong with you . there is something wrong with everybody in here . because we have lost a member of our family and you don ' t wanna talk about it , you don ' t wanna think about it , you just wanna get back to work ! 
there are five stages to grief , which are [ glancing at computer screen ] denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance . and right now , out there , they ' re all denying the fact that they ' re sad . and that ' s hard . and it ' s making them all angry . and it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance . and if not acceptance , then just depression . if i can get them depressed , then i ' ll have done my job . 
i am going to throw you this ball . when you catch the ball , i want you to say the name of a person very important to you , somebody really special who died , and then i want you to say how they died , and you may cry if you like , that is encouraged . let me just start . let me show you how this works . i catch the ball . i lost ed truck . and . . . it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears . . . and at the same time , somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer . . . and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone . . . and i ' m crying , and nobody can hear me , because i am terribly , terribly . . . terribly alone . 
okay , fine . hurry back . 
 [ as pam returns to conference room ] okay , we can start . um . . . 
yeah . pam , you ' re a member of this family . so we will wait for our family members . phyllis , you wanna give it a shot ? 
okay , why don ' t you throw the ball to somebody else . 
 [ returning ball to stanley ] oh , yes stanley . come on . your turn , you have to go . 
okay . . . i ' m going to toss the ball to pam . 
wow . if you wanna cry , that ' s okay . 
do you want to talk about it anymore ? 
wait a second . that ' s weekend at bernie ' s . [ upset ] do you think that this is a game ? 
all right , we ' re starting over . 
you are not leaving . no ! we are not done . 
yeah . well , you know what ? the guy who had my job has died . and nobody cares ! and he sat at my desk . [ breaking down ] 
how do you know ? 
that that bird was dead ? did you check its breathing ? 
was its heart beating , toby ? did you check it ? no , of course you didn ' t . you ' re not a veterinarian . you don ' t know anything ! [ runs out of conference room crying ] 
 [ seeing bird ] oh , god ! 
oh my god ! oh my god , come on . . . 
oh shhhh - - oot ! 
no , he ' s not . 
no , he ' s not . [ cradling bird next to face ] 
well , you can ' t get diseases from a bird ! 
we don ' t know if it ' s dead . 
attention everybody . this will only take a second of your time . today at 4 p . m . we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird . 
well , i ' m sorry to inconvenience you , meredith . but that is what you do when things die . you honor them . toby killed this bird . and now we are going to honor it . 
no , no , no ! that ' s enough ! you know what ? this bird is dead . he died alone . the least you can do is be there for him now . [ to dwight ] find a box for him . 
it ' s okay . it ' s okay . [ pats kelly on shoulder ] shh . . . yes , i know , i know . it ' s been a tough day , but it ' s good to let it show . 
what are . . . what are you doing ? 
no , god , no it ' s not ! what is the matter with you ? is that the beak ! ? 
glad you could all make it . 
dwight , do you have the box ? 
you made this ? wow . [ impressed ] that ' s . . . that ' s very nice . 
yes . 
shhh . 
society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong . well , that ' s baloney , because grief isn ' t wrong . there is such a thing as good grief . just ask charlie brown . 
oh , wow . he . . . 
does his family know ? 
but i ' m the first in the office ? 
okay , yes , sure , i will do that . . . 
 . . . ' cause i ' m the first to to find out . nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them . well , good . how are you holding up ? want me to come over ? [ jan hangs up ] 
ed truck died . and it blows . they say that with grief , time makes it worse , which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so i ' ve had more time to be sad . 
i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon , because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor . we need to find out what is blocking you . and that way , we ' ll be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored . may he rest in peace . 
what was that , kevin ? 
no , you said something , didn ' t you ? 
you think that ' s funny . 
you are disgusting . 
no , that can ' t be right . 
well , then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world , doesn ' t it ? 
you ' re ruining it , already . they should not be given the choice . 
wow . wow . no . no . you are the most heartless , soulless person i ' ve ever met . 
no . no . shh . enough . it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here . dwight , ryan , i want you to take the table out . we ' re gonna go on a five minute break , and when you come back , we ' re going to start with a clean slate , and , in the interim , i would like you to forget everything that toby has said , okay ? 
i don ' t think i ' m overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company . and he is worthless . you give people a chance to shine and they blow it , just like you knew they would . grief counseling is not about , " are you hungry ? would you like a sandwich ? " these people are so far gone , you have to stick a food tube down their throats . 
okay , part of the problem was that toby talked at you . now , i am going to talk with you . first off , i want you to be comfortable , because you really can ' t grieve if you ' re all tight and buttoned up . so , guys , loosen your ties , just take your jackets off if you want . ladies , let your hair down . you know what ? even take your shoes off . i wanna get personal and i want you all to really open up . and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said . 
i found an exercise in toby ' s binder that he managed to miss , that involves screening the part of you that says , " i don ' t wanna do that . i don ' t wanna talk about that . that is too private . " here ' s how it works . i ' m going to throw you this ball . 
 [ in his office playing with a dunder mifflin truck when it drops and the " head " of the truck comes off ] 
that ' s . . . hold it , hold it , hold it . start , like , right in there . [ dwight digs hole in ground ] just dig . 
okay , give it to me . you don ' t know what you ' re doing . all right . [ michael starts digging ] 
nothing . let ' s just . . . all right . [ talks to warehouse guys ] guys , do you have a box we could use ? 
uhhh . . . nothing . 
yeah , nothing . how was your day ? 
wow . well . ok . i don ' t care how your day was either , jan . i was just asking you because you asked me . why do you set me up like that ? 
i worked . and then i went home to my condo . and carol came over . and then we had sex . is that what you want to hear ? 
never ever , ever sleep with your boss . i am so lucky that jan and i only got to second base . 
hey koselli , the kos . cosby . hey hey hey . i love jello pudding pops . my son , theo , loves jello pudding pops too . 
productivity is important but how can i be productive if i have this one little thing in my brain ? that i cannot get out . and that one little thing is a soft pretzel . so i ' m just going to have my soft pretzel , then i ' ll get to work , and i ' ll be super productive . look out for me . 
 [ looks at long pretzel line ] oh , shhh . . . come on . 
uh huh . 
 [ phyllis embraces bob ahead in line ] hey , hey , hey ! phyllis , what are you doing ? 
no , i think you ' re cutting in line . 
no , i ' m not going to settle down . 
get in the back please . 
boooooo . thank you . [ hi - five ' s stanley ] . that ' s right . 
no cuts . oh , pam . just the woman i ' d like to see . you read my mind . 
i thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while i go to the bathroom . you ' re an angel . 
because i like them a certain way , and if it gets screwed up , then whole thing is blown . 
pam , productivity starts with patience and determination . i ' ll be back . 
hi . please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left . 
thank god . 
is there anyway that you could do all , all of them ? 
all right ! thank you ! 
mr . kosseli . hey hey hey , the cos . what ' s going on ? do we have a deal ? deal or no deal ? let ' s make a deal . so what is the deal ? 
oh ! hey ! everyone , i am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation . second . . . 
yes , second , toby . second , i am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you . 
and i will be taking questions . 
carmel dip . but , one question at a time please . phyllis , stanley . i want you to switch desks , i ' m going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything ! i think we ' re getting a lot done , don ' t you ? on paper at least . and we are , after all , a paper company . are we not , are we not , are we not ? are you with me , are you with me ? thank you very much ! 
hey , what time is it ? 
am or pm ? 
oh , good . 
oh . koselli . with the jello . 
yes . right . good . 
goodnight ! 
well , that ' s really not the way i roll , because sometimes i ' m in the zone , and sometimes i ' m in the zoning out . 
do you want me to go on amazon and order you a slang dictionary ? cause i ' ll do it . 
yes , big if . 
a woman spurned . 
i always do . 
if you lay a finger . . . 
would you look at that ? [ hugs ryan ] [ dwight attempts hug ] damn it , dwight ! come on . 
 " 9 : 00 to 10 : 00 , checked in with receptionist . met with jan , re : log . lost log . found log . " " 10 : 00 to 11 : 00 , light salad , three points . " that ' s on the wrong page . 
okay . that sounds good . [ puts banana in toy mouth that ' s in his mouth ] [ laughs ] yes . actually , today ' s a good day to do that . 
what makes them so good ? 
i mean , they ' re just dough twisted up with some candy . they taste so good in my mouth . 
nice dress , ryan . 
 [ laughing ] ok . 
tonight , one of our most ethnic co - workers , kelly , has invited us all to a diwali celebration put on by her community . what is diwali , you may ask ? well , to have kelly explain it [ girly voice ] it ' s ada blah blah blah , it ' s so super fun and it ' s going to be great . [ normal voice ] lot of gods with unpronounceable names . twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a hindu halloween . 
how come you didn ' t get me one ? 
hey . hey . stop that . that is offensive . indians do not eat monkey brains . and if they do . . . sign me up . . . because i am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional . 
it ' s important that this company celebrates its diversity . and you know what , stanley ? come kwanzaa time , i have got you covered , baby . 
wha ? really ? you should ! it ' s fun . 
i love the people here . and if there was one thing i di . . . don ' t really care for is that they can be terribly , terribly ignorant about other cultures . and i don ' t want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend , carol . 
diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus . but , frankly , i ' m a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture . so , without further ado , kelly you are on . 
kelly ? 
um . . . why don ' t you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday . 
all right , all right , all right , all right . this isn ' t ' lord of the rings ' . 
now , a lot of people say that kelly is one in a million and that ' s true , but it ' s also not true . because , frankly , there are literally billions of people just like kelly in the world . here are some famous indians . [ slide show ] subrahmanyan chandrasekhar . he is a nobel prize - winning physicist . impressive . apu from the simpsons . hilarious . indian . m . night shyamalan . ' the village ' , ' unbreakable ' , ' sixth sense ' , ' sig . . . ' 
okay . spoiler . . . alert . 
just stop it . [ slide of michael & amp ; carol kissing ] what ' s the . . . oh , whoa ! [ laughs ] where did that come from ? 
and another thing about the indian people . . . they love sex positions . i present to you the kama sutra . i mean look at that . who ' s seen that before ? 
thank you , kevin . 
well , i find it beautiful . 
no . . . 
no , you ' re not going to collect them . 
no . this is delightful , charming culture . 
my indian culture seminar was going great until toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images . it ' s just sex . people . . . everybody does it . i ' m doing it . . . with carol ! probably tonight . 
 [ points at woman ] what does that look like to you ? 
no one ' s even going to notice . 
hey , kevin . it ' s a costume . why don ' t you just cool it , okay ? carol ? carol . 
i ' ll have one of those as well . thank you very much . now these are limes , lemons , onions . . . 
oh , yuck . [ spits out food ] 
no . these s ' mores are disgusting . 
do you think they have any s ' mores ? 
all they are is chocolate , graham cracker , and marshmallow . how difficult would that have been ? 
wow , thirty years ? and you two only met once before the wedding night ? 
wow . 
oh ! she ' s not a cheerleader . she thought this was a costume party ! um . . . no , we ' re not married . . . yet ! 
she is . very fair and very kind . so . . . um . . . tell me , is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire ? no ? okay . it ' s still very cool . ok . thanks ! 
i ' m going to be . [ to dj ] hi , i ' m just going to get this for a sec . . . just a sec . [ speaks in microphone ] um . . . everyone ? i ' m sorry , could i have your attention , please . thank you . ah - hah . . . hi . sorry . i just have an announcement to make . um . . . okay . i have learned a lot about indian culture tonight . but i have learned even more about love . and i know you ' re all thinking ' who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about ? ' well , i ' m not crazy . maybe i ' m crazy in love . so without further ado , carol ? carol stills . i would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband . 
what do you say ? 
i didn ' t hear you . [ laughs ] 
 [ lowers microphone ] oh , you ' ve got to be kidding me . okay . 
no . i get it . i get it . you ' re not ready . we ' ll wait . this is a classic . . . 
yeah , well , but i . . . i feel like i ' ve known you many lifetimes . maybe i ' m hindu after all . okay , i ' m not hindu , but . . . carol . carol , i just . . . i feel like . . . i just like you so much . 
yes . 
ok . okay . good night . [ louder ] hey , you know what ? why don ' t i come with you . cause i ' ve got this book called the kama sutra . 
all right . good night . 
oh , god ! [ chokes on food ] oh . wow . 
that ' s so spicy . 
oh . you waiting for a call ? 
wow . pam . when carol said ' no . ' tonight , i think i finally realized how you must be feeling . we are both the victims of broken engagements . 
i was in that marriage arena , though . 
yeah . uuuuh . . . well . 
we ' re so alike . so alike . [ leans in to kiss her ] 
what are you doing ? 
i ' m . . . what ? i didn ' t 
 [ scoffing noises ] can i have a ride home ? 
these are not my shoes . this is just like that show ' taxi cab confessions ' . 
sorry . 
this is going out to indians everywhere . it ' s a tribute to one of the greats . . . mr . adam sandler . [ sings ] diwali is a festival of lights . let me tell you something . tonight has been one crazy night . so put on your saris , it ' s time to celebrate diwali . everybody looks so jolly . but it ' s not christmas , it ' s diwali . the goddess of destruction kali stopped by to celebrate diwali . don ' t invite any zombies to a celebration of diwali . along came polly to have some fun at diwali . if you ' re indian and you love to party , have a happy , happy , happy , happy diwali . happy diwali ! 
how do i explain this to jan ? 
oh , please , stop talking . three words or less . 
an indian halloween . okay , great . [ to phone ] pam , could you put jan on , please ? 
hello , jan . 
well , i was letting everybody go to the big diwali party . 
what is diwali ? 
you don ' t know what diwali is ? wow , jan . i ' m surprised . it ' s the hindu festival of lights . i just assumed you ' d be familiar with it . it ' s the most sacred and honored hindu holiday in the world . it ' s like christmas , easter , and halloween - - - 
 - - - rolled into one . 
i bet you ' re not even aware that our own kelly kapoor , who works in . . . 
 . . . customer service is a hindu person . 
and . 
yeah . 
you do ? 
oh , i dunno about that . 
for kelly , that seems a bit much . 
 [ hangs up ] 
yeah , you should see her naked . 
i had promised carol a romantic evening on the town . um , i wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing , but it was like seventy dollars a person , and she ' s allergic to hay . so i said , " pop a claritin , and i will spot you the seventy bucks , " and she ' s like " i don ' t like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication . " and i ' m like , " well you ' re really not gonna like what i slipped in your drink last night . " and she ' s like , " what the hell are you talking about ? " and i ' m like , " i ' m kidding . i didn ' t put a roof . . . " [ cracks himself up ] . . . we laughed so hard . . . it was hilarious . . . oh . . . [ calms down ] so yes , i ' m very excited about the diwali party . 
and perhaps the most important person to indian culture , sir ben kingsley . because of him , the british left india , and then he became an actor like ronald reagan . 
yeah ? 
so , any questions ? 
there she is - jan levinson . first . . . 
 . . . thing in the morning . love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of jan . 
 [ singing ] just call me levinson in the morning , baby . 
yes . 
i don ' t understand . 
on whom ' s authority ? 
what ? 
you ' re welcome . 
am i a small number person or a severance package person ? 
oh . . . [ burrys head in hands ] oh , my god . oh , my god ! i don ' t really get it ' cause we ' re not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up . 
well . . . 
oh , you gotta be . . . josh ? 
oh really , what role is that ? king of the stupid universe ? 
it is an outrage , that ' s all . it ' s . . . hey ' re making a huge , huge mistake . let ' s see josh replace these people . let ' s see josh find another stanley . you think stanleys grow on trees ? well they don ' t . there is no stanley tree . do you think the world is crawling with phyllises ? show me that farm . with phyllises and kevins sprouting up all over the place . ripe for the plucking . show me that farm . 
pictures . memories . [ picks up a framed photo of stanley ' s daughter from stanley ' s desk ] look at that . they grow up so fast . 
don ' t say that . that just sounds weird . please . 
well . . . we have nothin to talk about , dwight . just do your work . . . while you still can . 
yeah , great ! amazing . best physical condition of my life . 
nothing . just checking in . i can ' t tell you , so . . .

ok , ok . . . 
 [ facing the whole office ] listen up , everybody . . . i have some news . we are screwed . dunder - mifflin , scranton is being shut down . 
you knew about this all along , didn ' t you ? 
traitor . you are a traitor . 
i don ' t know . probably not . this is the worst . 
darryl . noble darryl . [ sighs ] 
i know , i know . well , i ' ll land on my feet . don ' t worry about me . 
so , you ' ll be okay too . you ' re a warrior . you ' re smart , capable . you ' ll find something else and . . . 
awesome . 
this is my house . the cfo is taking away my house and giving it to josh . and josh is giving the garage to bob vance . 
all right , listen up . some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing . but , i am not going to take this lying down . i have a plan and i am going to save our jobs . so just hang in there . [ looks at dwight ] let ' s go . 
yes . this might get ugly . i need backup . 
go to new york , confront the cfo , show him he ' s making a mistake . . . save the branch . 
no . . . way . 
no . there ' s no one else . 
okay , okay . um . . . 
why ? 
you sent him cards ? you never met him . 
okay , this is it . [ runs up the stairs of cfo ' s house , with dwight ] this is exactly what michael moore does , famous documentarian . he goes up to people with a camera and he ' s like " why did you do this ? why did you pollute ? you are bad . you ' re a bad person . " it ' s very dramatic . although , i can ' t say i was a big fan of ' bowling for columbine ' , because i thought it was going to be a bowling movie , like ' kingpin ' . and it wasn ' t . it was something else . 
i will improvise . i will speak from the heart . 
all right . 
excuse me , mr . wallace ? david wallace ? 
can you tell us why you are shutting down scranton and putting 15 people out of work ? 
yes , but these are employees , sir . these are human beings . 
 [ no longer talking to dwight as wallace ] stop . . . stop it ! just , okay . he ' s not going to say any of that . 
because he ' d be intimidated and i , just . . . let ' s start again . just be more scared of me , okay ? 
don ' t touch me this time . 
excuse me , mr . wallace ? 
 [ takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie ]

let ' s face it . moving to a new job can be very stressful . so i have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers . but it ' s not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen . it ' s funny . it ' s got a little bit of a zing to it and i hope that it gives you a flavor of what we ' re all about here at dunder mifflin . and what we ' re all about here in scranton . so let ' s just all laugh together and watch " lazy scranton " . 
sittin ' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon , call my man dwight just to see what was shakin ' . 
so check out how we live 
they call it scranton . 
the electric city . scranton . 
the electric city . call poison control if you ' re bit by a spider . 
 [ in video ] i am so scared . . . when people don ' t label their personal food . 
you like coal mines and you wanna see ' em , well , check it out , yo , the anthracite museum ! plenty of space in the parking lot , 
 [ on video in background ] spot . scranton . what ? the electric city . scranton . what ? the electric city . scranton . what ? 
well , so far , i think it is killin ' . i thought it would either be an ' a ' or an ' a + ' but i completely forgot that there ' s an ' a + + ' . 
oh - kay . sorry to interrupt . i . . . 
all right . 
okay . 
what is that ? a squid ' s eye or . . . 
how did you . . . 
people hate people that are different from them . that ' s natural . but you know what makes people forget their differences ? a great show . that is why i created the ' integration celebration ' . this is the moment when scranton and stamford come together as one . united in applause . 
i know what a lot of you must be thinking . ' wow ! what a day ! feels more like a night at a party than a day at work . ' well , in my opinion , business should feel like a night out . a night . . . at . . . the roxbury . okay . there ' s supposed to be music and it ' s . . . i got it , i got it ! i got it . dwight ! just . 
ssshh stupid ! um . . .

why are the new people on the table ? to show them that we are not above them .

i understand . we ' re all friends . 
oh , well . just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up .

don ' t be shy ! dwight ! let ' s do this ! 
come on . we ' re doing this thing ! let ' s get up . 
bend at the knees . okay , here we go . here we go . i ' m under this . . . i ' m under this hock here . i don ' t know what i ' m grabbing here . 
we ' ve almost got it . push it ! push it ! 
i ' m right in your crack ! 
up and over . 
up and over . 
you ' ve got it . 
you ' ve got it , you ' ve got it . 
whoa whoa whoa ! okay . 
easy .

i don ' t understand . 
well , we ' ll squeeze you in . 
you can ' t quit ! on the first day . that ' s [ deep voice ] heresy , my friend ! [ regular voice ] okay , let ' s talk about this . what happened ? i mean , what . . . was it toby ? did he say something ? cause he ' s . . . what ? 
my management style ? so . . . didn ' t you think ' lazy scranton ' was funny ? 
okay . well , don ' t bother quitting because you ' re fired . 
you are fired ! i ' m sorry , but we don ' t have quitters on this team ! just clean out your desk ! 
don ' t try to apologize to me , man ! it ' s too late . just get out ! take your bad vibes with you . 
probably the best advice you ever gave me , dwight . 
whoa , angela ! hold on . hooters is a restaurant . with over 400 locations worldwide . 
no . we do have to get along . can ' t we all just get along ? or have we forgotten the words of the reverend king . 
the word merger comes from the word marriage . and that was what today was supposed to be . the loving union between people . instead , it has become like when my mom moved in with jeff . and once again , it becomes my job to fix it . 
hey ! hey , everybody ! something happened ! those guys from vance refrigeration , they let the air out of our tires . 
yeah ! they punk ' d us ! they punk ' d us good ! come on . come on ! 
man , they got us so bad . we cannot let them get away with this . we have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators . 
yeah . 
go home , toby . just . . . 
why ? i will tell you why . because they saved the worst for me . they put a hate note under my windshield wiper . check this out . it ' s so hateful . [ reads note ] " you guys suck ! you can never pull together as one and revenge us . that is why you suck ! " 
no . no , no , no . no . you are falling for it . you ' re playing right into their hands . this is just what they want you to do . don ' t , oh . . . 
this is egregious ! this is egregious ! 
see that ? mission accomplished . like a bunch of fourth graders . sometimes , what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady . although that ' ll change . because , by the end of the fourth grade , the lunch lady was actually the person i hung out with the most . [ answers phone ] jell - o ! 
hi , jan ! 
i did . major personnel crises averted . compliment accepted . 
yes . 
but do you realize that that was actually dwight ' s idea ? bad advice from my number two . 
what ? 
yes , i know that . for , i do read the memos . 
so after a great deal of thought and introspective - shun , i have decided to make jim my new number two . 
uh . . . that i have not decided yet . 
thank you , andy . that ' s . . . very kind . thanks . 
shut it . . . 
shut it ! that ' s . . . [ whispers to camera ] suck up !

all right , just . . . 
smiles . 
good , what ' s funny ? 
oh , nicknames , yay ! penguin power . 
good . 
hey , girls . what ' s happening ? startinng to blend ? well , before long , you guys keep hanging out , you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle . 
can ' t we all get along ? no , we can ' t . but here ' s the thing : yes , we can . well , why not ? because of differeneces . well , can we overcome these differences ? no . can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences ? no , we can ' t . but , we have to try and that is why i created the integration celebration . 
i need somebody to pick a card . [ dwight raises hand ] one of the new people , please ? tony ? [ tony walks away ] 
all right . good . thank you . [ andy picks a card ] do not look at your card . now , i ' ve always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here [ puts hand over heart ] . so to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts . turn over your card . 
so i think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be [ starts to fan out the rest of his cards facing the group showing kings of hearts ] a king of hearts . 
dwight , don ' t , don ' t be a suck up . 
what i want all of you [ points at scranton branch ] to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them . who wants to start ? who wants to give it a shot ? 
okay meredith , let ' s give it a shot . 
 [ clapping ] beautiful . very good , nice . 
okay . 
we heard it . 
we heard what you said . you didn ' t cover it at all . 
 [ points at camera ] they ' re gonna have . . . you can ' t say that , all right ? 
 [ clearing throat noise ] idiot . dwight ' s an idiot ! did you catch that or did . . . did the cough cover it ? 
 [ cleaing throat ] you ' re a jerk . dwight ' s a jerk ! 
ohhh , wow . look at that . how cute . 
ohh . may i ? 
 [ climbs under desk ] hey , look at me , i ' m a baby ! i ' m one of those babies from " look who ' s talking . " what am i thinking ? [ laughs ] look at all those staplers ! what ' s a stapler ! ? i don ' t even know , i ' m a baby ! hey , mom , i ' m thirsty ! i ' m thirsty , mama ! i want some milk . and you know where milk comes from ! breasts . 
yeah , jan , it um . . . looks like a check , piece of paper of some sort . receipt . i don ' t know . 
i didn ' t hire an ex - convict . unless they mean toby . convicted rapist . [ jan sighs ] . . . i ' m just kidding . 
hey jan , speaking of stamford , hannah brought in her baby . 
hannah ? 
kuhhhh . . . you are such a racist . 
because you think he ' s black . 
stop it . stop it right - stop it right now . 
why did the convict have to be a black guy ? it is such a stereotype . i just wish that josh had made a more progressive choice . like a white guy . . . who went to prison for . . . polluting a black guy ' s lake . 
in our society , a black man can be arrested for almost anything . he was probably at a sporting event and . . . saw some people pushing each other , and he intervened . 
sssssso , what we need to do . . . is to forget about this whole martin in prison thing . people will draw unfair conclusions about martin and or black people . 
good . all right . [ everyone leaves ] 
just . . . try to be cool . 
okay , are you cool , really ? 
um . . . martin , from stamford , was , at one time , in prison . [ dwight starts to run ] no . dwight ! be cool ! be cool ! 
hey martin , how ' s it going ? 
ah . good good . good . just a second . everybody ? may i have your attention please ? i realize that a lot of you have already heard that martin here has had some trouble with the law , but i just want to declare publicly that i . . . trust . . . him , completely , and that anybody who doesn ' t is an ignorant , dumb . . . person . okay ? as a matter of fact , you show me a white man you trust and i will show you a black man that i trust even more . pam . tell me a white person you trust . 
 . . . danny glover . [ jim raises hand ] yeah . 
who ? 
oh . please . colin powell . 
yup . 
apollo creed . 
close your eyes . picture a convict . what ' s he wearing ? nothing special , baseball cap on backwards , baggy pants . . . he says something ordinary like . . . ' yo , thats shizzle . ' okay . now slowly open your eyes again . who are you picturing ? a black man ? wrong . that was a white woman . surprised ? well , shame on you . 
no . that ' s not cool . you don ' t have to tell them . 
 [ laughs ] that is awesome . 
well , we are running a business , so . 
ah . well . that ' s not true . 
no you would not . 
this place is not prison . it ' s . . . way better than prison . 
okay ! listen up everybody ! um , you guys said that prison was better than this place , and i heard ya , loud and clear , so , i am instituting some changes to make this more like prison . we are going to start with an hour of outdoor time . so let ' s go ! 
why don ' t we . . . pump some iron ? anyone wanna . . . pump up ? 
it ' s uh . . . two and a half . i ' m not going for bulk , i ' m going for tone . 
yeah , it ' s . . . freaking cold out here . anybody wants to stay out , you ' ve got about . . . twenty - seven minutes of rec time . 
oh heyyy . martiiin . you have tv in the joint ? 
ah . a ten inch black and white ? 
these people don ' t realize how lucky they are . this office is the american dream . and they would rather be in the hole . 
all right everybody , there has been a lot of name calling against our office today . corporate maligning , slurring , much of it coming from one of you , who claims that prison is better . . . than . . . here . and none of can say " boo " because none of us have ever been to prison . well , there ' s somebody i ' d like you to meet . somebody else who has been to prison , who can tell you what it is really like [ puts on bandanna ] . i ' m prison mike ! you know why they call me prison mike ? ! 
do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall , beeyotch ? ! [ employees protest ] all right , hey , hey , hey , hey , that ' s just the way we talk in the clink . been a lot of fun talk about prison today , but i am here to scare you straight . i am here to scare you straiiight ! ! in prison you are somebody ' s bitch . oh , and you . [ points to ryan ] you , my friend , would be da belle of da ball . don ' t drop the soap ! don ' t drop the soap ! 
internet . 
and prison . eh , fifty - fifty , both . look , prison stinks , is what i ' m saying . it ' s not like you can go home , and , recharge your batteries , and come back in the morning and , be with your friends , having fun in the office . 
i stole . . . . and i robbed . and i kidnapped . . . the . . . president ' s son . and held him for ransom . 
and i nevah got caught , neither . 
gruel . sandwiches . gruel omelettes . nothing but gruel . plus , you can eat your own hair . 
yeah . yeah . well , thank you , andy . tanks . 
the worst thing about prison was the . . . was the dementors . they . . . were flying all over the place , and they were scary . and they ' d come down , and they ' d suck the soul out of your body , and it hurt ! 
no , not harry potter . . . . there are no movies in prison . this is my point ! you guys got it soft , and cushy ! this place is freaking awesome ! the people are awesome ! your boss is nice ! everyone seems to get along ! people are tolerant ! people who . . . have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves ! nobody is nobody ' s bitch . i hope that this scared you . and from me , prison mike , to you , i just wanna thank you for listening to me . letting me be a part of your life today . ' cause you got a good life ! you got a good life . a good life . [ turns around , takes bandanna off ] so . what do you think ? it doesn ' t sound so great , does it ? 
okay . okay , fine . you guys think prison is so great ? all right . well , here you go . [ locks employees in conference room ] 
no ! if you think is prison is so wonderful , then , enjoy prison ! they are such babies . i am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it ' s like to have freedom . and if this doesn ' t bother them , then i am out of ideas . 
they were very disrespectful to me , and to the office . and martin has had a bad influence , to think that i gave him the benefit of the doubt . 
okay . you know what toby ? i am teaching them a lesson , so . 
 [ unlocks door ] okay nutcases , get out of there ! good work . long day . really long . why don ' t you guys head home . early . time off for good behavior ! heh . good job . enjoy your freedoms ! 
martin went from being a new guy from stamford . . . to a convict , to . . . my friend . back to a convict . then to . . . a kind of a nuisance , actually , to be completely honest . and finally , to . . . a quitter . and i will not miss him . and that is not because he is black . 
 [ riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing ] deck the halls with boughs of holly . fa la la la la la la la la . [ struggling to stay on ] ' tis the . . . ack . [ expletive ] hey ! [ to pam ] i would like a nice slice of christmas pam . side of candied pams . and perhaps , some pam - chops , with mint . . . 
i ' m looking for the toy drive box . 
ok . . . well , i need to put this bike in there . i hope it ' ll fit , with all these little knickknacks . 
umm . . . i don ' t know ? average kind ? 
well , that is probably from the test drive . 
no . 
oh , thanks . [ michael and andy do a fist bump and explosion . ] 
yes ? [ pam holds up a bag ] oh pam , that is so sweet . you didn ' t have to do that . 
ok . did everybody get one of these ? 
terrific . good . 
this is going to be the best christmas ever . my girlfriend carol is coming to our party tonight , and i have a little surprise for her . [ singing ] i ' ve got two tickets to paradise ! pack your bags , we ' re leaving the day - after - tomorrow ! um , taking her to sandals , jamaica , all - inclusive . all - inclusive . you know what that means ? right ? yeah . 
there she is . a christmas carol . hello [ kisses carol ] you ' re about five hours early to the party . you ' re such a blonde . [ laughs ] 
hey , everybody . i don ' t know who you haven ' t met yet , but i think this is one of them . this is my girlfriend - carol . this is just the front of her . show ' em , show ' em the other side . 
turn around , turn around . come on . [ making a body turning gesture ] 
no , you get outta here . 
yes . 
thank you . 
not as much as i need a moment alone with you . [ puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt ] berp . 
that is my christmas card . it ' s a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip , having a blast . ski - sons greetings . 
i know . 
right . 
yes , but what you didn ' t realize at the time was that i was with you in a sense . i was in your heart . . . 
and next to your kids . what ? 
i don ' t understand ? 
ok 
no , no no no ok , ok , you know what , you ' re not thinking straight . you know what you need ? you need to think this through in [ making drum noise ] jamaica ' s largest fresh water pool . 
i got us tickets to sandals , jamaica , we leave day after tomorrow . [ carol shakes head in disappointment ] . you better find the skimpiest bikini there is . 
and it ' s all inclusive . 
yes . 
no , carol . you walk out that door and it is over . 
i ' d like everybody ' s attention . christmas is canceled . 
keep it up stanley and you will lose new year ' s . 
jim , take new year ' s away from stanley . 
carol and i split up . amicably . and i just don ' t think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances . 
fine ! [ everybody stops talking ] have your party . just no guests . 
well , you know what phyllis ? all of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway , leaving your life a stupid rotten mess . 
oh , oh , oh , oh , it hurts . 
it hurts my heart . it hurts my stomach . it hurts my arms . 
 [ moves a little ] thanks . how did you push away the bad thoughts ? 
like maybe , the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed , that were , foreign , and scary ? 
and not that you didn ' t want to try them . some wine may have helped . do you know what i ' m referring to ? 
take it from toby . 
hey , would you like to go to sandals , jamaica with me ? 
it ' s all . . . [ pam walks away . ] ok . 
what are you doing ? [ " goodbye my lover " by james blunt plays ] 
carol ? 
i don ' t have to buy it . i just want to taste it . i just . . . i just want a little taste of it . 
 [ singing ] goodbye my lover . goodbye my friend . [ hits repeat again ] 
this is an old adage , but they say when you find true love , you know within the first 24 hours . with carol , i knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day i met her . 
all right . nothing here to distract myself with anyway . 
hooters ? 
ah , i need my entourage [ both exit michael ' s office ] jim . dwight . ryan . c ' mon , we ' re going to asian hooters . 
why not ? 
ok , feel better . 
c ' mon jim , let ' s go . 
bros before hos . why ? because your bros are always there for you . they have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason . and you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you . and that she was better than all the other hos in the world . and then . . . and then suddenly she ' s not yo ' ho no mo ' . 
dwight , just , just leave them alone please . they ' re on a date . they look very happy . 
carol used to drink lattes . 
she would get this little foam mustache . . . 
and i used to say " hey , got latte ? " and she ' d say , that ' s not funny . 
she totally got me . she understood that we didn ' t have to laugh to enjoy - - - 
i ' m already starting to forget what color eyes she had . i can ' t , ok , i ' m gonna call her . i am gonna call and find out . . . 
i ' m just gonna call her . 
nothing he ' s doing is cheering me up .

 [ laughing ] i don ' t know what he ' s doing . 
you know what we should do ? 
we should invite them to the christmas party . 
oh , you are such mench my friend . [ they stand up and do fist bump and explosion ] 
ok , where is everybody ? i would like them to meet my new girlfriend . [ guys walk in with two different waitresses from benihana ' s ] 
the least i could do was give some poor sick kid a bike . 
nah , you rock . tell you what , if you want it , it ' s yours . 
oh . [ she whispers in his ear . michael starts to laugh ] that ' s what she said . 
hello ? i would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend .

shhh . . . shut it ! c ' mon ! party . 
we ' re going to . . . 
i just think there are two , two specific kinds of people in the world . people who own houses and people who own condos . [ turns to reach for pretzel while second cindy turns other direction ] and . . . my question to you [ points and pulls away other waitress ] is do you agree ? 
do you agree about what ? [ laughs ] wow . you ' re lucky you ' re so darn cute . 
what ' re you talking about ? 
when you know , you just know . 
check her out . my little gal over there . babe - alectable . 
it ' s . . . it ' s one of those two . [ points at both ] 
yeah . . . well , it ' s been hard , they ' re wearing the exact same uniform . and i ' ve been drinking . and you know how all waitresses look alike . 
i honestly don ' t see what the big deal is . stevie wonder is married . are you going to tell me that stevie wonder doesn ' t love his wife just because he ' s not sure what she looks like ? 
hey . where ' s my girl ? is she in the fridge ? where is she hiding ? i don ' t know where she is . ' cause i ' m drunk , i can ' t even find her .

you want help ? ok . . . merry christmas . 
that waitress was the one . 
how can you be sure ? 
don ' t make fun . . . you ' re making fun of me . 
i guess , i didn ' t know her very well . i marked her arm . 
i , i put a mark on her arm . [ both are laughing ] so i could tell them apart . i don ' t . . . i know , i know . i can ' t believe i gave her my bike ! 
oh , why do i feel like crap ? 
i had rebound ? yeah . 
i totally rebounded . someone else shoots and i take the ball and i score . well , i guess i didn ' t score and i ' m not sure who ' s actually shooting , but , whatever . doesn ' t matter . it ' s all good . or as my ex might say . domo arigato , mr . scott - o . 
 [ on phone ] yes , i just wanted to see if , uh you would like to come to jamaica with me . there ' s this resort called sandals . really ? ok . all right . i promise you won ' t be disappointed . umm , it ' s all - inclusive . . . 
william randolph shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays , and i ' m paraphrasing here , " love doth be poison . " brilliant . and a lot of people don ' t give shakespeare enough credit . they think it was somebody else . a - holes . 
no , no , no , no . you know what , i better hold off . i wanna make sure i don ' t dial carol before i get drunk . 
yeah . you know what ? i am . i ' m gonna call her . that ' s a good idea . 
 [ on [ phone ] no , i don ' t think i ' m asking too much . i think it ' s only fair that you tell me exactly what i did wrong . okay . uh huh . well that . . . yeah . uh huh . all right . well , could you tell me something that i did right ? 
oh , honey , here ' s stanley . 
he is also in an interracial relationship , so , you know , if you have any problems , you can always call him .

hey , mon ! 
blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . relax .

yeah . . . gosh . great . you know what , pam ? make a note . i want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three . 
inventory ' s at the end of december . 
i specifically went on vacation so i would miss it . 
inventory is boring . in the islands , they don ' t make you do stuff like take inventory . why do you think so many businesses move to the caymans ? 
tonight , we are going to have an inventory luau . i want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the dunder mifflin warehouse inventory . so , party planning committee , get on it . 
the jamaicans don ' t have a word for " impossible . " 
how hard is a luau ? all you need are some grass skirts , pineapple , poi , tiki torches , suckling pig , some fire dancers . that ' s all you need . 
come on in . settle in . settling . settling . . . and settled . good , there is something i would like to show everybody . see this sign ? [ points to a tv monitor of a picture from jamaica and reads ] " no shirt , no shoes , no problem . " this is an attitude i would like all of you to have right here . so what , if we have to stay late to do inventory ? no problem . 
no , no , no . no , that ' s a german woman named urkel grue . 
jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble . so officially , i did not see her . but i did see jan there . in our room . at night . and in the morning . that ' s all i ' m gonna say . sex . we had sex . i had sex with her . i had sex with jan . 
 [ on phone ] hey dude . i just got back from jamaica . 
yeah , that sounds amazing . you know what ? the lady jan levinson wanted to go to montego bay . 
well i ' m looking at a photo , right now . and i ' m telling ' ya , could be in maxim . 
oh no ? 
ok . well , check this out . i am sending you some email . you got it ? 
check it again . hit refresh . 
ok , wait a second . i sent it to you at . . . [ reading computer screen ] packer @ dundermifflin . com . packaging @ dundermifflin . com . uh oh . 
darryl ? ! hey . hi . where ' s darryl ? 
ok , hey , man , how ' s it going ? 
that ' s great , ok . um , so did you get an email from me ? 
ok . well , that was supposed to go to packer , not " packaging . " did you already , um , forward to a whole bunch of people ? 
ok . um , well , did you get the second email that i sent ? explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it . 
and you sent that out to everyone ? 
i have a special assignment for you . 
a sensitive email has been released to the office . it contains a file , a picture . the file name is " jamaican jan sun princess . " 
not important . 
ok , forget it . 
not now , not ever . 
aww , none of your business . 
that photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo , then i am going to call the cops . 
this is probably the icebreaker you need . 
i bet you would love all the details , wouldn ' t you ? skeevy little perv . 
no , no , no . i am not dating jan . she was very clear about that . just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth . got enough , weirdo ? 
ok . 
oh , god , no . no , no ! hang up ! hang up ! tell her i ' m not here . tell . . . tell her , i ran out for cash . i hit a deer . i hit a deer with my car . tell her i hit a cat . tell her i hit a cat . 
she bought it ? [ pam nods ] ok . ok . 
there an accident ? somebody hurt ? 
oh . god . no , no , no , no , no . 
all right . [ continued clapping and cheering for michael ] 
hello . hi . attention everyone . um , apparently , there is an email circulating around that contains a very pg - 13 rating picture of me and a woman - - - 
no , kevin . a woman . maybe jan , maybe . . . 
my point is that , if you get it , i would ask that you just delete it . sight unseen . let ' s be professional , all right ? 
feelin ' . . . feelin ' hot , hot , hot ! [ plays conch shell ] 
hey . 
island living . you know ?

so , umm . . . thanks for coming by . so , i , uh . . . 
well thanks for coming over , i appreciate - [ jan leans over and kisses michael passionately ] 
jan , you . . . complete . . . me . 
i just had the best , most romantic week of my life in sandals , jamaica . went with a lady , and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free , because it was all - inclusive . and then i flew back to scranton , and then they lost one of my bags . 
hey , mister tally man , tally me banana , six hand , seven hand , eight hand , brunch ! [ snickers ] so delicious . dinner , too . and every morning i would watch the sunrise and i would eat a mango . that is how i want to feel all the time . it ' s called island living . you know , how they say take a chill pill ? in jamaica , i took one . guy on the beach sold it to me for $ 40 . and after i finished vomiting , i was more relaxed than i ever have been . lost six pounds , too . that ' s how i want every day to be . 
yeah , mon . me just got back to the office . 
me had an i - rey time . 
dwight , please , please . 
i just got back from vacation , mon , all right ? so chill . let ' s don ' t . . . don ' t harsh my mellow , mon .

andy , i got you a genuine jamaican t - shirt . they love milli vanilli down there . 
you are so welcome , mon . angela , you just got leied . [ puts lei on angela ] 
yes , you did . okay . oh , pam , i forgot to get you something .

stanley , i got you some ganja . i ' m just kidding . it ' s coffee . i bet you wish it was ganja . 
i just got back from vacay . come on . give me a break , man . [ holds up cd ] waves over jamaica , $ 6 . 99 . 
okay , let me tell you a little story . when i was on vacation , i met a man named bavon . and bavon takes people parasailing . and you know what he said to me ? he said that he loves going to work every day . how many of you can say that you love going to work every day like bavon ? [ dwight and andy raises hand ] no one . 
his name is bavon . and you know what ? i ' m sure bavon gets sick of his job , too . i ' m sure he would like to take a day off . i ' m sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper , but he has the right attitude . and that is something that you learn when you go to jamaica , and you really apply yourself . 
i would love to take them all to jamaica , but is that good management ? yes . but is it the best management ? well , i can ' t afford it , and corporate won ' t pay for it . so who ' s the real criminal ? 
how many of you know the meaning of the jamaican term , hakuna matata ? 
i . . . 
oh , that ' s red eye . 
well . . . 
hey , can we just focus ? 
okay . well , jan ' s email password is not dunder mifflin , sandals , jamaica , michael , michael scott , jan scott , or mrs . jan scott . 
her passwords aren ' t going to be dwight , dwight . that ' s stupid . okay . 
don ' t you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that ' s able to eat up that other emails ? i read about something like that . well , i am in america and i am online , so i do think it involves you . uh - huh . and if i were a subscriber , would then you be able to send out the gobbler ? i ' d . . . yes , i will hold . 
 [ kelly singing ] hey ! hey ! stop your mouth , please . 
hey , stanley , in case i don ' t see you again after tonight , here is your bonus , $ 1 , 000 cash . keep the change . [ hands stanley a piece of jamaican currency ]

ugh . . . that is a long story . um , couple of months ago , dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment . 
hawkman . 
 [ walks out of the ladies ' restroom ] let ' s go . the men ' s room was disgusting . 
hey , did you catch that up at lake wallenpaupack ? 
you know , i used to go up there all the time with my step - dad , and i never caught anything that big . 
you know what ? let ' s get right down to it . dunder - mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse , but what we lack in flash , we will make up for with hardwork and decency . 
i think what andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company , we will give you the care and attention of a small company . 
no . 
stop it . [ puts his hand on andy ' s shoulder ] stop it . 
yes . 
ah , no . don ' t worry about it . 
what ? 
i don ' t know . who knows how words are formed . 
yes , andy . 
he didn ' t say . 
no , you are remembering it wrong . 
dwight betrayed me once before . so this is his strike two . you know what they say ? fool me once , strike one . but fool me twice , strike three . 
i knew it . [ dwight and jim walk in ] 
where were you this morning ? 
why do you lie , liar ? 
you are lying right now . 
i know that you went to corporate this morning , and i know that you lied about it . and given our history , i need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing . 
ok , you know what ? i want you to think about your future in this company . i want you to think about it long and hard . 
don ' t . don ' t you dare . i want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day . 
good luck . 
yes , dwight schrute has left this company . more personnel turnover . 
yes , well . it is a big loss . dwight was the top salesman . . . 
i said ' was ' . 
what does that even mean ? that is impossible . 
but , there is some good news . oscar is back . addition by addition . so we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody ' s spirits . 
hey , what ' s up . 
yep . 
i don ' t know . maybe . 
bathroom . 
wow . [ walks over to the plant ] what is wrong with this thing ? it looks terrible . 
yeah . and you know what ? ask them about the toys on my desk too . they always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way . it used to brighten my morning . 
really ? that was very nice of him . we need more attitude like that around the office . 
yeah , do you ? 
what did i say ? 
huh . 
oh , no . 
love that andy , right ? solid fellow . seems smart enough . likes me a lot . a lot . too much . like a crazy person . a little . not super crazy . . . just . . . there ' s something about him that creeps me out . i can ' t really explain it . he ' s always up in my bidness . which is ebonics for " being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me . " i don ' t understand how someone could have so little self - awareness . 
no , hey , hey . don ' t be ridiculous . of course we are going to have a party . a celebration of oscar . oscar night . and i want it to be oscar - specific . 
no , no , no . i mean , not because you ' re gay . your gayness does not define you . your mexican - ness is what defines you to me . and i think we should celebrate oscar ' s mexicanity . so phyllis . . . i want you to go find firecrackers . and a chihuahua . pam , in the frozen food section , swanson makes a delightful chimichanga . 
ah , a burro , of course . if oscar wants a donkey , let ' s get him one . 
who ' s that sportscaster that bit that lady ? marv something ? andy is like marv something . great sportscaster . big weirdo creep . 
hey guys . how ' s the workload on all of dwight ' s old accounts ? handling it okay ? 
yes , he did . have any of you talked to dwight ? 
really ? 
don ' t - don ' t do that . that ' s not nice . what about you , phyllis ? you and dwight were close . 
nice to have oscar back . 
why would dwight do that for you ? i think i know why . because dwight loves this company . 
do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you ? 
pam , i have a mission to accomplish . make sure this party gets rolling and i will be back shortly . 
um . 
no . i don ' t want to do any of that . 
no , just stop . stop . stop doing it . you ' re going to drive me crazy . 
hey . 
what ' s up ? 
um . it takes a big man to admit his mistake . and i am that big man . angela from accounting told me what you did . 
yes , she did . and dwight , if you were willing to do something like that for some random co - worker , then clearly i have misjudged you from the beginning , and i apologize . 
how ' s this place treating you ? 
oh , well . 
no . i ' m sure . 
so , maybe you should come back . you should come back . please . 
we can talk about that . [ dwight high fives michael ] all right . 
ladies and gentlemen ! may i present . . . mr . dwight schrute ! 
okay , dwight , you can let go of her hand . you ' re gonna break it . [ looks around the room ] not bad , huh ? 
guilty . 
pam . i will shake mine and then you will shake yours . 
so does this remind you of your childhood right now ? 
wow . thank you . wow , that ' s - - thanks so much . 
and now , ladies and gentlemen , the big finale ! sir , would you do the honor ? [ hands broom to dwight , though oscar thinks he ' s handing it to him ] 
it takes a big man to admit his mistake and that ' s what i did . the important thing is i learned something . i don ' t want somebody sucking up to me because they think i ' m going to help their career . i want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me . hmm . 
hello son . if you ' re watching this , that means i ' m already dead . life is a road - - - 
how , would you stop interrupting please ? 
yesterday i was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and i gave myself the nastiest shock . and when i came to , i had an epiphery . life is precious . and if i die i want my son to know the dealio . the dealio of life . 
here are some things that i want to teach you that your mother won ' t be able to . 
to jump start a car , first pop the hood . then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine . then you take these and clip them wherever . 
number eight , learn how to take off a woman ' s bra . 
we will demonstrate on pam . 
come on . 
 [ dwight is wearing a bra ] you just twist your hand until something breaks . 
well you get the picture . thanks pam . 
and remember no matter what , i will always love you . 
he ' s not going to be a murderer . 
you know what , dwight , do you want to do this , or no ? 
okay . from the top . ready ? three - 
hello everyone ! as you know , we are six days away from phyllis ' wedding . [ applause ] so get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did . and karen , um , you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don ' t already have one . this may be phyllis ' only wedding ever . it is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins . so i am instituting prima nocta . 
i ' m sorry . i had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant . 
i ' m trying to get everyone excited about phyllis ' wedding because i want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes . which won ' t be hard , because it ' s going to be awesome . a lot better than hers , that ' s for sure . it ' ll probably be on a boat . 
what ' s up spinsters ? 
no problem . the guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse . from 2 : 30 to 3 : 15 . it is the only time that bob was available . sort of a guy ' s night out . a g - n - o if you will . a gah - no . actually , it ' s more of a guy ' s afternoon in . a g - a - i . a gay . not - not - it ' s uh , not gay , it ' s just a , it ' s a bridal shower for guys . a guy shower . an hour long shower with guys . 
yes . yes ! oh ! there - oh ! [ clutches chest and falls to the floor ] 
oh god - 
no , no , no ! 
i can ' t believe you ' re not going to be there . it ' s going to be good , it ' s going to be a great bachelor party man . 
you should get out of them . 
it ' s the only time he can do it . 2 : 30 to 3 : 15 . it ' s going to be great . we ' re going to be doing some darts , we ' re going to be grilling up some steaks , got some pie . going to be very delicious . 
i did not order a stripper . 
um , not personally , no . 
i can ' t get a stripper here . sexual harassment . 
so that ' s what that means . 
okay everybody , slight change of plans , we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught - ay . uh ! [ spanks himself ] 
gay . 
okay . co - ed naked strippers in this office . for realsies . 
okay . we are off . ryan and i are going to go get some supplies and i need you to handle hiring the strippers .

half pants , right mr . franklin ? 
he ' s in his knickers . mr . franklin , i would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever . 
yes , but , ben franklin was . 
and when they came over on the mayflower . bow chicka bow . 
yeah , alright , so i want you to give him your undivided attention and mr . franklin , if any of these ladies misbehave i give you permission to spank them . especially that one . [ points to phyllis ] 
look at that . nothing like grilling in the great outdoors . 
no . yes . 
but i got all the foot off of it . 
guys , beef ! it ' s what ' s for dinner ! who wants some man meat ? 
well then my man meat , he shall have . there you go . deliciousity . 
i call shuffle . here we go . [ spreads cards out all over the table ] 
ah , gentlemen , the entertainment is here . everybody i ' d like to introduce you to elizabeth . 
nice outfit .

okay . alright , i ' ll do it . yeah . lets do it . lets do this thing . yeah . what do i ? 
alright . 
okay . 
here we go . alright ! 
not bad ! not bad ! you smell nice . like tide . 
you smell like tide detergent . do you use tide detergent ? ha ha ha ! i have a girlfriend so . . . 
yeah she probably , yeah she would be . you know what , okay , excuse me . please stop it , stop it . turn off the music . this is wrong , this is wrong ! this is wrong ! i have a girlfriend . and you are engaged and i ' m sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay . shame on you . go back to work ! 
on one hand i want to be honest with jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand i ' m afraid she ' s going to dump me . 
really . 
well , ben franklin , you ' re really kind of a sleezebag . 
stripper ? could i ask you a question about women ? um , should i tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me ? 
wow . thank you . 
not really , look i don ' t know how to say this so i just will . 
i went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand . 
no , today at work . 
yes . i kind of arranged it . 
so you don ' t want to end our relationship ? 
that is so sweet . you are the best gd girlfriend in the world . do you know that ? 
you are . you are . 
so you know who turned out to be kind of a creep ? ben franklin . and elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice . which rhymed . really makes you wonder how ben franklin can become president , but someone like elizabeth can ' t . 
always the bridesmaids , right ladies ? 
phyllis is getting married . and i am in the wedding party . she has asked me to push her father ' s wheelchair down the aisle . so , basically , i am co - giving away the bride . since i pay her salary it is like i ' m paying for the wedding . which i ' m happy to do . it ' s a big day for phyllis . but it ' s an even bigger day for me . employer of the bride . 
there she is . i swear phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at dunder mifflin . 
how you doin ' ? you excited . 
me , too . if you need to vomit , that is ok . i did . do you want to talk about tonight ? 
you ' re probably worried about pleasing bob . a lot of pressure . phyllis , did you break wind ? it ' s okay , if you did . it ' s a very natural reaction . it ' s your wedding . and you ' re nervous . . . 
okay . . . umm . . . i ' m sure that bob . . . wow . that is . . . that is pungent . i lost my train of thought . aaah . . . are you set on that hairstyle ? 
here , let me . . . 
just cover up that bald patch . 
okay . 
you might be surprised to learn that i ' ve only been to one other wedding . it ' s actually a very cute story . my mom was marrying jeff . and they asked me to be ring bearer . i was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet . 
 [ in video of michael as a kid ] i hate you ! 
long story short : jeff ' s dog ended up as ring bearer . and the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said ' boo ' . 
this strappy young lad sitting here is phyllis ' father , albert , and he is quite the ladies ' man , aren ' t you albert , hah ? ah , ringbearer . i could have done better . i will do better . i am going to be better . i can ' t believe i ' m actually doing this ! ooh ! are you ready for this , albert ? i am . let ' s do it . 
 [ whispers to father ] that ' s ok . [ albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking ] 
this is bull * * * * ! 
me walking phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding . and now . . . the wedding has no highlight . 
i can ' t believe i pushed that . . . that guy ' s lazy ass around all day . . . until he was ready to stand up and steal the show . that ' s . . . well . . . i got news for you , albert . if that ' s your real name . the show ' s not over . 
ladies and gentlemen , may i present to you for the first time as a couple , mr . and mrs . bob vance ! 
oh , shiii . . . 
ladies and gentleman , for the first time as a couple , mr . and mrs . bob vance . [ generalized clapping and cheering ] yeah ! that ' s what i ' m talking about ! 
congratulations , bob . you ' re a good man . but just know . . . if you ever lay a finger on phyllis , i will kill you . 
agreed . no fingers will be laid on phyllis . [ to albert ] oh , decided to sit down again , huh ? great . bet you can hear me , too . 
phyllis ! are you happy with everything ? what can i do to make it more perfecter ? 
i ' m already on it . the chicken ? totally undercooked . i sent it back . 
i will take care of that . 
i do . i know a fair amount about fine food . . . and drink . this is a white . 
thank you , randy . that was great . thank you . thank you very much . hi , i ' m michael scott and for the next forty minutes , i ' m going to be your tour guide through the lives of phyllis lapin and bob vance . one of the great , seemingly impossible , love stories of our time . my name is michael scott . webster ' s dictionary defines " wedding " as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch . well , you know something . i think you guys are two metals . gold medals . for those of you who don ' t know me , i ' m michael scott , phyllis ' boss . to quote from the princess bride " mawige . . . 
the most important part of a speech is the opening line . when time is not a factor , i like to try out three or four different ones . 
phyllis and bob : their celebrity couple name would be phlob . you look at her . . . and she ' s kind of matronly today , but back in high school , i swear , her nickname was ' easy rider ' . now as for bob . . . bob vance . . . 
is a guy that . . . 
he works . . . okay hold , hold on , hold on . look . look . i didn ' t say anything when phyllis ' dad upstaged me at the ceremony . and i think you owe me this . kay . 
no . i ' m not going to . . . 
ok . all right . 
oh . yeah . you ' re out of here ! you ' re . . . yeah . i hate you ! 
come . . . come on ! 
dwight , just . . . 
look , i just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake . i ' m not even going to dance one song . 
ok . 
 [ sings ] ee . . . i was meant for you . . . buppity du bom bu . 
i just want phyllis to have a great day . 
we are great together . we are a great team . 
yes . yes . they were . robert parrish ! i should talk to her . i don ' t want this to ruin her honeymoon . 
dude , keep it together . i listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head . 
phyllis . phyllis ! wait ! please . i ' m sorry . i just . . . i just wanted to make this a day to remember . 
yeah . yeah . he ' s kind of a weirdo . 
you ' re . . . you ' re welcome . 
they say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake . i say that ' s crazy . i say let them eat cake . margaret thatcher said that about marriage . smart broad . 
be careful . oh no ! ! [ phyllis and bob smear cake on each other ' s face ] oh wow ! phyllis ! phyllis ! you look like a clown ! here . get me ! get me ! [ michael smears cake on his own face ] 
oh hey , kevin , nice of you to join us , where were you ? 
huh ? 
pop quiz . 
why is today a special day ? 
today ' s a special day , because i am being honored as a . . . visiting . . . professor , special lecturer , emeritus . . . how did you , how did you . . . 
in business school , kevin . business school . 
a boss is like a teacher . and i am like the cool teacher . like mr . handell . mr . handell would hang out with us , and he would tell us awesome jokes . and he actually hooked up with one of the students . um . . . and then like twelve other kids came forward . it was in all the papers . . . . really ruined eighth grade for us . 
here we go . college roadshow . gotta bring our . . . a game . what was the most inspiring thing i ' ve ever said to you ? 
will they throw their hats , you think ? 
a lot of times , at a . . . school , or naval academy , after a rousing speech , the crowd would throw its hats high into the air . 
yeah , i know , i know . i ' m just saying if they did throw their hats i ' ve got a great line for that : " may your hats fly as high as your dreams . " . . . that was a pretty good line . 
i understand ! wow . relax , spazzy boy . sometimes you ' re such a little spaz ! [ pokes ryan ] whoa , hey ! 
we have fun . 
campus . brings back so many memories . . . . that i would have made . hey . frisbee . check that out . aww ! what do you say we get our fris on before class ? [ runs over , throws frisbee ] whoo ! 
okay , this is it . ryan is doing my intro right now . 
i can ' t hear what he ' s saying , but he looks like he ' s really into it . 
hello everyone , i am michael scott . and i would like to start today by inspiring you . may i borrow someone ' s textbook , please ? thank you . what have we here ? ooh . economics . very , very interesting . [ rips pages out of book ] you cannot learn from books . replace these pages with life lessons , and then , you will have . . . a book . . . that is worth its weight in gold . [ gives book back ] i know these are expensive , um , but the lesson is priceless . good . alright . i think you ' re inspired . shall we proceed ? there are four kinds of business : tourism . food service . railroads , and sales . and hospitals slash manufacturing . and air travel . 
so , you wanna start a business . how do you start ? what do you need ? well , first of all , you need a building . and secondly , you need supply . you need something to sell . now this could be anything . it could be . . . a . . . thingamajig . or a . . . a whosi - whatsi . or . . . [ pulls out a candy bar ] a whatchamacallit [ throws bar ] . now , you need to sell those in order to have a payday [ takes out a payday , throws it ] . and , if you sell enough of them , you will make a 100 grand [ throws 100 grand bar ] . [ pulls out a snickers ] satisfied ? 
okay , i ' m seeing some confused . . . faces out there . let me slow down a little bit . break this down . okay . the more stickers you sell , the more profit , fancy word for money , you have to buy playstations and beanie babies . 
 . . . and products ! 
well . . . okay , i was just kind of getting it going . um , alright . well , okay , we can do questions . okay . very good . first hand up . 
we can ' t overestimate the value of computers . yes , they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails . but real business is done on paper , okay ? write that down . [ everyone types on their laptops ] 
 . . . i say you will miss our service , and i absolutely guarantee you ' ll come back . 
 . . . we don ' t want them back , ' cause they ' re . . . stupid . 
nice try , how ' s your pollack - says - what index ? 
thanks , kowalsky . um , can we get on track here ? 
 . . . wait , ryan said that ? 
yeah sure , you know business , sitting up here in your ivory tower . and your ebony tower . you know what ? tell you one thing , dunder - mifflin is here to stay . 
david will always beat goliath . 
yeah , yeah . you know what else is facing five goliaths ? america . al - qaeda , global warming , sex predators . . . mercury poisoning . so do we just give up ? is that what we ' re learning in business school ? 
dunder - mifflin is the big picture ! can ' t you understand that ? no , you can ' t . you ' re too young . ryan . . . has never made a sale . and he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita . and everybody thinks he ' s a tease . well you know what ? he doesn ' t know anything , and neither do you . [ walks out ] so suck on that ! 
business is always personal . it ' s the most personal thing in the world . when we get back to the office , pack your things . 
you heard me , pack your things . 
fire you ? no , no no . you are moving . . . to the annex . 
a good manager doesn ' t fire people . he hires people and inspires people . . . . people , ryan . and people will never go out of business . 
pam - casso ! sorry i ' m late , i had to race across town . 
wow ! you did these . . . freehand ? 
my god , these could be tracings ! ohh ! look at this one . wow ! you nailed it . [ sighs ] . . . how much ? 
i don ' t see a . . . price . 
well , yeah . yeah , we have to have it for the office . i mean , there ' s my . . . window , and there ' s my car ! that your car ? 
that is our building . . . and we sell paper . . . . i am really proud of you . 
what ? 
 . . . chunky . do you want half ? 
okay . 
it is . . . a message . it is an inspiration , it is . . . a source of beauty . and without paper , it could not have happened . unless , you had a camera . 
well ultimately i went into business to inspire people . they say those who can ' t do , teach . i can do both . i teach doing . 
wow ! that ' s a lot of books , do you have , umm , one book that sums up all of these . 
so no ? 
oh , umm , ever since i started here , i ' ve kept a diary of all my sales . 
no , it ' s just mileage mostly , but there ' s one chapter that i call wisdoms . i ' m going to read you a series of statements , and i want you to tell me , on a scale of one to ten , how smart they are . 
don ' t do what i say , say what i do . 
just getting warmed up . mistakes are just successes that you mess up . 
this . . . you know this is a scale of one to ten ? 
ok . do you want me to repeat that ? 
everybody please stand , and get up on your desks . [ goes to stand on desk ] just stand right up . 
that ' s , yep a little flimsy . umm . . . ok . . . ahh . . . alright , no more desks . oh ok . 
i have a lot of big ideas , and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs , in a way that is easy to swallow . simple . . . [ holds up snickers ] kids love candy bars . 
lets try a little . . . little social experiment here . raise your hands if you like to buy things . ok , i see some people who like to buy things . you ' re it , you are the reason this world rolls along , give yourselves a round of applause . say , say you want to start a business , and business is all about buying and selling , is it not ? so say you want to sell lemonade , or stickers . something you have to keep in mind , you must , and you might want to jot this down , you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for . 
oh , oh , i take umbrage to that premise . . . ses . umm , let me ask you this : how many people exist in the world ? over forty billion . what are they going to be writing on . . . rocks ? any one else ? [ points ] yep . 
no no no no no . never follow , always lead . 
ok . 
very good . 
ok . 
bop bop de bope bop bop bop bop bop . you only have me for a limited time . . . yes . 
how can i put this ? that question makes you sound gay . 
can you confirm that the straps are tight ? 
and now , the chains . 
a lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids . and that ' s why so many other people in my class were kids . self fulfilling prophecy . it ' s um , it ' s really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school . 
magic magic magic magic magic magic . . . and now , michael the magic , will attempt to escape from extreme bondage . [ kevin giggles ] can he do it ? i don ' t see how he can . 
no . no . everyone , now count down with me . three ! 
i will get out . oh yes , i will . 
no . alright , this is getting hot . so let ' s just do this . ok , ready ? three , two , one , go . [ michael spits out key , jim covers it with his foot . ] 
ahhhh ! 
yes . 
i cannot tell you how i plan to escape . other than by using magic . that is the magician ' s code . separately , on an unrelated note , if you happen to find a small brass key . . . 
alright . 
ready ? come on guys . early worm gets the worm . 
pam , would you smell my breath ? 
 " michael , you go to parties all the time , why is tonight so special ? " well , tonight is so special because my boss ' s boss ' s boss , the cfo , not his initials , common mistake , is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company . and jan and i are going as a couple . for the first time . so it ' s kind of our coming out party . really . and that is why tonight is so special . 
jimbo , last chance to carpool . 
sure ? might be a good idea . 
go in together , could save some gas , have some fun , long trip . 
play some games ? 
i spy ? 
oh , sure . really didn ' t give it any thought . wait , should you be going ? [ phone rings ] heh - woh you . 
hey , buttercup .

ok . 
ok . jan . jan ? this party is actually a really big step for us . so , i . . . 
ummm . . . i don ' t know . 
maybe . 
ok . 
alright . bye . 
beauty . thank you sir ! 
thank you . 
shut up . ok , change shirts with me . 
i don ' t care . oh , wow . here . don ' t put my jacket . don ' t give me that . 
yes . 
ok . 
hi . 
actually , it ' s polite to arrive early . and smart . only really good friends show up early . ergo de facto . go to a party really early . become a really good friend . 
oh , um , potato salad . 
no , it ' s not . 
oh , you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here . 
it ' s been sitting in my car all day . sun beating down on the mayonnaise . just , you never know . 
what are you looking for ? you bring dip ? 
awesome . i ' m going to frame mine . i could frame yours too . 
over our love . 
you don ' t have to , jan . this contract says it all . 
it ' s a heart . 
i love this woman ! 
rachel . boy , you clean up good . place looks great with all the lights on . and everything . actually looks bigger with people in it . it ' s weird . so . . . 
jan and i are lovers . it feels so good to finally say that out loud . 
ok . 
it did . like butter . mike myers , snl . you should ask karen , she was one of them . 
yeah , but you ' re great now , right ? we ' re all great . aren ' t we great ? 
i could go for an appeteaser . 
bagel bites or something . 
dwight , wow . that ' s not appropriate . 
david , how much did this house cost ? 
here is to mr . iacocca and his failed experiment , the de lorean . [ takes sip , coughs violently ] 
yeah . do you have any ice ? 
how about some splenda ? 
this one really smells like vanilla . check that out . 
you and the misses should join us at sandals jamaica next christmas . 
oh yeah , they don ' t allow kids at sandals . they are persona non gratis . . . there . but it ' s fun . it ' s an awesome place . you would not believe how low this girl can limbo . 
crazy . 
ok . excuse me . what ' s going on ? what is it ? 
what are you doing ? 
yes , but you could tell me . what . . . what is that ? why are you ? why are we going in the bathroom ? i thought this is where you liked your privacy . 
what has gotten into you ? 
no , no , no . 
come on , let ' s go back to the party . 
don ' t take that dress . stop it , jan . 
no , no , no , means please don ' t . please . 
i ' m not going to slam you up against the wall . 
you ' re acting inappropriate . jan . 
rachel thinks that i brought homemade potato salad and i just picked it up at the supermarket . it ' s funny . i wish i could make potato salad that good . it ' s just potatoes and mayonnaise . there is something wrong with jan . 
our first fight . if this is about what happened in the bathroom , there was no place to cuddle . . . 
you didn ' t have any of the potato salad did you ? 
well , if that ' s the way you feel , my lady , then you have hurt me greatly . 
i ' m not going to cry . i feel like it but i am not going to . why don ' t you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces . 
i want the house , jan . i want the picket fence . i want the ketchup fights and the tickling , and the giggling . 
whatever . 
that ' s all , you didn ' t mean it ? 
i love you , jan . 
what a weird day . i don ' t understand it , but you don ' t get to understand everyday of your life . maybe five , ten days a year , i ' ll get home and i will have no idea what the hell just happened . guess everybody has days like that . sometimes they ' re the nicest ones . still , i think there might be something wrong with jan . 
no need for consternation , everything is under control . 
it was a crime of passion , jan , not a disgruntled employee . everyone here is extremely gruntled . 
no . . . 
no , he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he ' s just using this roy thing as leverage . 
yeppers . 
i don ' t . . . remember . 
yeesh . . . 
ok i want you to be darryl and ask me for a raise , because i want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you . 
wikipedia . 
wikipedia . . . is the best thing ever . anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject , so you know you are getting the best possible information . 
ok , darryl , ask me for a raise . 
hmm , well that ' s interesting darryl . i think . . . [ mumbling softly ] that maybe you should . . . [ mumbling jibberish ] 
what i ' m saying is that , [ continues to mumble jibberish ] 
ok , see what i did ? 
by leaning back , and by whispering , i established a dominant physical position . 
ok , let ' s try another one . um . . . 
walking out of the room unexpectedly . 
it ' s a surprise . 
go ahead , ask me for a raise . 
 [ gets up and begins to walk out of the room ] 
what ? 
no , what did you say ? 
oh it . . . sounded interesting . . . what you were gonna . . . 
 [ knock on door ] yeah . 
yes , yeah , absolutely . have a seat . 
you know what ? actually , let ' s go into the conference room . 
no , you know what ? let ' s stay here . no let ' s go . . . yeah let ' s go to the conference room . 
tactic number six . change the location of the meeting at the last second . totally throws ' em off . 
number 14 , declining to speak first . makes them feel uncomfortable , puts you in control . 
 [ long pause ] i am declining to speak first . 
hmm . ohh , darryl . you are a good worker , and a good man . i just , you know , times are tight . and i just don ' t think corporate is going to go for this right now . 
what ? 
no , this is a power suit . 
 [ darryl laughs ] i do not buy woman ' s clothes . i would not make that mistake again . 
ohh . . . kay . 
all right . 
alright , you know what ? pam , could you please tell darryl that this is not a woman ' s suit ? 
no , i do , i , i wear men ' s suits , ok ? i got this out of a bin . 
there were these huge bins of clothes , and everybody was rifling through them like crazy , and i grabbed one . and it fit ! so i don ' t think that this is totally just a woman ' s suit . at the very least it ' s bisexual . 
uh , [ reading the inside of his jacket ] missterious . and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side . . . that ' s the mystery . 
okay . 
would you stop it , please ? 
it ' s european , ok ? it ' s a european cut . 
no , they don ' t . see ? [ michael lifts his jacket tail , sticks out his back side and shows pam ] 
italians don ' t wear pockets . 
no , i don ' t want to do that because i ' m twice your size anyway . 
um , let ' s just do this in 15 minutes . 
negotiations are all about controlling things . about being in the driver ' s seat . and make one tiny mistake , you ' re dead . i made one tiny mistake . i wore woman ' s clothes . 
let ' s get down to business . why don ' t you tell me why you think you deserve a raise . 
 [ mumbles jibberish ] 
 [ mumbling softly ] that was a very good point . 
 [ mumbling softly ] you make a very compelling argument . 
i am going to give you a piece of paper . i want you to write down how much you want , and i want you to slide it back across the desk to me . 
because , that is the way these things are done . in . . . films . [ darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to michael ] no , slide - - - slide it , yes . 
oh . [ scoffs ] come on . be serious . 
i . . . i can ' t give you that , i - - - i don ' t make this much . 
i don ' t . want me to prove it to you ? there is . . . a pay stub . 
plus perks , yes . 
fourteen years . 
no , please , please . . . 
ok , let ' s take 15 , again . 
a boss ' s salary isn ' t just about money , it is about perks . it . . . for example , every year i get a $ 100 gas card . . . can ' t put a price tag on that . 
oh , thank you . 
i didn ' t give you $ 40 . 
okay . okay , here ' s the straight . . . dope . no tricks . no wikipedia . 
i talked to corporate , and they told me that i can only give you a 5 % raise . 
well what am i supposed to do ? 
i ' m not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now . that is ridiculous . 
 [ exhales ] that ' s true . 
you know what ? i should . 
i have been a loyal employee for a long time . 
you know what ? i deserve a bump . 
i am makin ' it happen , sergeant . 
no , jan . i ' ve never asked for a raise in 14 years . this is long overdue . i wanna do it today . 
yshhyah . um , yeah . i ' ll leave right away . 
yes , i ' m bringing darryl . 
mm - hm . 
hey , i ' d rather kill myself . 
 [ talking over jan ] no , toby is terrible . toby is the worst human being i ' ve ever known . 
 [ sighs ] fine . 
toby , come on . let ' s go . 
where ? i ' m gonna smack you in the head with a hammer . come on , let ' s go . 
yeah . fine . 
 [ imitating chris tucker ] don ' t ever touch a black man ' s radio ! . . . chris tucker . rush hour . i won ' t touch yours , by the way . 
well . . . 
mm , the big apple . 
maybe i ' ll stay . 
well . . . 
 [ mouth full of pretzels ] oh , i . . . 
pippity poppity , give me the zoppity . 
all right . 
who ' s the boy toy ? 
were you going to tell me that you hired james van der beek ? 
be nice to get a memo , we are lovers . 
pippity poppity . 
six percent ? after all we ' ve been through ? 
i got you . . . jade earrings . 
no ! 
no . you gonna play it like this ? you give me a good raise , or no more sex . [ toby begins to write ] [ to toby ] what are you writing , perv - ball ? 
why don ' t you just take that pen and stab me in the heart . this is me , jan . this is me ! 
okay , no , no , no , no . you do not try tactic number eight on me . i invented tactic number eight . i ' m not going anywhere . 
ohh . it was a weird day . i accidentally cross - dressed . and then darryl made me feel bad for not making any money . and then i had to ride up here with stupid toby . and then , your assistant , is all young and hot . and i - - - 
well that ' s ridiculous i ' m not gonna make - - - 
ah , so . . . all right , levinson . here ' s the rub . i would like a 15 % raise . 
but you just said 15 . 
negotiation is an art . back and forth . give and take . and today , both darryl and i took something . higher salaries . win win win . but you know , life is about more . . . than just salaries . it ' s about perks . like having sex with jan - - 
look , i am not a gazillionaire . i can ' t . . . i can ' t dress like donald trump dresses . i have to stay within the parameters of my budget . i can ' t shop at a fancy norwegian boutique . i buy my suits the old fashioned way . i buy them from discount stores . . . or on ebay . and when i found out that ross was having a midnight madness sale , i ran , not walked , as per the instructions on the flier . and i got there , and when the doors opened , all of these women ran to this one bin . and i did too . and i grabbed this suit . and a woman , sort of a , i don ' t know , missy elliot type , grabbed the jacket . and , uh , we had kind of a heated tug of war . and i could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get . and i figured she was just buying it for her husband , to answer your question from before . um , anyway , she s . . . socked me , in the eye . and she got it , she got the suit . but , i went to the ross , in trenton new jersey , and i found the exact same suit . and i didn ' t have to deal with missy elliot . 
today is safety training day . toby is leading ours upstairs . yeauck . but , i am giving everyone a little bit of a treat . we are going to listen in on darryl ' s presentation to the warehouse . and if i know darryl , it gonna be zoppity . 
hmm . 
i can , and i have . 
guys , i ' m not the only one who ' s driven the forklift . [ points ] pudge has driven the forklift . 
i thought your name was pudge ? 
okay . um , her . 
ah , fine . 
yeeesh . 
 [ barely keeping his composure ] " hey darryl , how ' s it hangin ' ? ! " [ laughs ] 
bail ' er ? i hardly know her . 
yes , yes . but it wouldn ' t be the worst thing in the world . . . if somebody . . . 
it ' s a big red trash compactor ! 
okay , okay ! i got it . i got it . . . . only on the rarest of occasions . . . 
 . . . would i go near - - - 
toby now has the floor . . . and he is going to try not to screw this up , like everything else in his life . let me rephrase that . i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl . here we go ! 
yes , good . fine . like stretching and . . . 
wow , that is . . . that time really adds up . that ' s like . . . a half an hour , every hour ? 
ok , you know what ? you ' re making it sound kind of lame . so , skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff . like sometimes computers can explode , can they not ? 
ok , you know what ? i think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom . [ to warehouse guys ] sorry , he is very lame . [ takes book from toby ] um , let ' s see . " seasonal affective disorder ! a depression that includes weight gain , fatigue , irritability , brought on by the low light of winter . " 
ok guys , you know what ? i didn ' t - - - i didn ' t interrupt when you were having your presentation . 
yes . okay , let ' s do another one . this is a good one . " a particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style , which can contribute - - - " 
yes . " which can contribute to heart disease . " heart disease kills more people that balers . 
mmmm , no , no , it ' s . . . sedentary . . . 
no . 
darryl , i did not walk out in the middle of yours . so , i - - - 
okay . . . . what , nerf isn ' t cool anymore ? 
darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse . i worked in a warehouse . men ' s warehouse . i was a greeter . i ' d like to see darryl greet people . probably make ' em feel like wimps . not me , i . . . " hello , i ' m michael . welcome to men ' s warehouse . we have a special on khaki pants today . " . . . this is one example . 
pam , depression is as scary as a baler , right ? 
working in an office can lead to depression . which can lead to suicide . i mean this is really serious stuff . 
i - - - i - - - nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler , and yet those guys are makin ' fun of me , calling me a nerf , that . . . 
yeah . . . you are . . . ah , so right . they had visual aids . and all we had were the facts . you don ' t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity . you go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball , your hair sticks up straight . . . and you know science . 
indubitably . 
they use props . they use visual aids , and they just made us look like dopes . 
i don ' t know , i don ' t know . because you know what our killer is ? depression - - - 
nn - - - depression . 
yes . 
no time to sew a quilt . . . . i got it . give me the number for the giant big box toy store . 
you may be asking yourself , " what am i doing on a trampoline ? " well , i thought i ' d bounce here for a while , relieve some stress , and then move on with my day . not ! here ' s the plan . dwight , is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys , we ' re going to have another safety seminar . only this time , where ' s michael ? oh my god ! he is on the roof ! now i have got their attention . i . . . tell them , about the cold hard facts of depression . and then i say , " hey ! you ever seen a suicide ? " and i jump . and they freak out . and they get to see . . . the dangers of depression with their own eyes . nice side note : they might think " hey , i should have been nicer to michael . " but that ' s . . . not why i ' m doing this . . . then , i land on the trampoline , take a couple extra bounces for fun . i climb off , walk around the corner . . . ta - freakin ' - da ! [ dwight nods ] 
maybe we should test it first . letterman - style . throw a tv over , or . . . 
go buy some watermelons . 
just . . . 
let ' s do it ! drop that sucker . 
bingo ! whoa whoa whoa ! oh . . . crap . deactivate the car alarm . clean up the mess . 
find out whose car that is . if it ' s stanley ' s , call the offices of james p . albini , see if he handles hate crimes . 
also , take apart the trampoline , stick it in the baler . 
have pa - - adge do it , or . . . the sea monster . 
yes , thank you for seeing that . 
i don ' t know if i wanna do this . 
no . no more . the tests are going terrible . if we keep doing it , we ' re not gonna want to jump . this is about doing , not thinking . 
rock n ' roll ! 
that ' s right ! i am not thinking . 
yes ! yeah ! 
woo ! 
woo ! 
i am ready to do this ! i am ready to make a point ! [ dwight continues air guitar ] 
 [ on the roof ] my life ! oh , my life . . . 
everything ' s wrong . the stress of my modern office , has caused me to go into a depression . 
dwight , you ignorant slut . depression is a very serious illness . over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year ! according to a 2004 study ! 
yes ! my head is in such pain ! and turmoil ! 
wait , where are the warehouse guys ? 
okay . . . that ' s . . . 
that ' s the whole point , dummy . 
okay . 
oooooh , my life ! 
everything is wrong , dwight . the stress of my modern office , has made me depressed . 
dwight , you ignorant slut . 
and that is why , i am going to jump off this roof ! 
damn it . 
what is it ? 
dwight , find out what the present is . 
dwight , you are such a liar . pam , really , what is it ? 
you told me , that i lead a . . . cushy , wimpy , nerf life . 
what do i have to live for ? 
it ' s complicated with jan . and i don ' t know where i stand , or what i want . the sex isn ' t nearly as good as it used to be . 
do you really mean that ? 
i ' m braver than you ? 
i braveheart . i am . 
okay . pam , i ' m coming down to get my present . 
an office . . . is as safe as the people in it . and sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office . that ' s the danger i found myself in today . i saved a life . my own . am i a hero ? i really can ' t say . but , yes . 
ok , come on everybody , go time . pam let ' s go . 
don ' t worry pam , you will be answering phones for the rest of your life . . . your long lovely life . [ whispers to camera ] saved it . 
here we go . 
field trip . 
like we ' re going to the science museum . 
learn by touching . 
i ' ve been told that i ' m a tactile learner . 
kelly , ryan looks great . you should be thankful that you . . . 
i . . . 
sum it up darryl , sum it up . 
we got beat today , dwight . 
but it was not a fair fight . 
it was the warehouse guys . . . 
 . . . dwight , they embarrassed us . . . 
 . . . because they had a much scarier safety presentation . 
you know what ' s funny ? robin williams . [ sighs ] when a cat gets stuck in a washing machine . city slickers . talking like borat . you know what ' s not funny ? safety , or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety . [ in borat voice ] not nice . i must show people how dangerous office can be . high five . . . now that ' s funny . 
how do you make depression sexy ? how do you . . . how do you get people interested in depression ? that is the conon . . . the conun . . . the conumbery 
those warehouse guys , think that we are all flabby , middle management , nerf balls . well i ' m going to show them that we have nerfs of steel . [ winks ] 
yeah , drew . 
you know drew , why don ' t you go inside . dwight come here . where should we put this ? 
ok , good . thank you . wanna take our time , do this right . 
i ' m going to wait . i don ' t want to say this twice , it ' s too painful and i ' m too depressed . 
i will miss you the most ryan . 
coal miners , crab fishermen , dog the bounty hunter , all dangerous jobs . but also upper middle management . [ takes deep breath ] wow ! i could have fallen off a roof today . . . and you don ' t worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat . . . and there are no roofs in coal mines . 
 [ on phone ] it is disgusting . i totally agree . well , we ' re going to recalling all of that paper . 
we have a crisis . apparently , a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock . five hundred boxes has gone out , with the image of a beloved cartoon duck , performing . . . unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like . i ' ve never been a fan . 
everybody in here . stat . no time to lose . cri - man - squa . f and c , doubletime . 
crisis management squad . 
front and center . twice as fast as you would normally go . any other questions ? 
to save time , jim . 
you know what ? bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh ! forget it . where is creed ? 
creed . quality assurance . your job . i really think you screwed the pooch on one , creed . because of you , the entire company is in jeopardy . 
we have a lot of angry customers out there . this puts us at threat level midnight . accounting , you are on customer service duty today . 
midnight , oscar ! don ' t worry , kelly will be training you first . 
jim , big fire in your house . your client , dunmore high - school , sent out their prom invitations on this paper . went home to all the kids . 
no , no , no , no . not good enough . this is a keystone account . i want you in the school . in person . 
i want you to bring a partner . 
no , sweet cheeks . we need someone who ' s actually made a sale . andy , you go . 
no , no . i need two men on this . that ' s what she said . no time ! but she did . no time ! guys , get on this . dwight , i want you to be in charge of the press conference . 
no , pam . the press is just gonna find out by themselves . 
here ' s the thing . when a company screws up , best thing to do is call a press conference . alert the media , and then you control the story . wait for them to find out , and the story controls you . that ' s what happened to o . j . 
i have invited barbara allen , one of our oldest clients , to come in here , and meet with me , for a personal apology . the press wants a story , i will give them a story . 
here is your headline . " scranton area paper company , dunder mifflin , apologizes to valued client . some companies still know how business is done . " okay ? battle stations everybody , let ' s go , go , go , go , go , go ! 
ok , press conference in 45 . dwight , make sure this place looks nice . 
mrs . allen is our most important client . . . because every client is our most important client . even though she ' s a pretty unimportant client , really . 
and so , with the eyes of the nation upon us , i would like to say that dunder mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident . and , as a gesture of gratitude , for your continued loyalty , mrs . allen , i would like to present you with this novelty check , for six months of free paper or 25 reams , whichever comes first . 
so , let us consider this matter ended . 
i know , i know you ' re angry . and we are truly , truly sorry . 
well , we are extremely sorry . 
we . . . are going to do everything humanly possible , to ensure that this never happens again . 
the watermark . . . it ' s a one time thing . 
ok . . . 
what . . . can i do , for you ? 
well . . . [ exhales ] ok , well . . . um , wasn ' t really my fault . the guys at the papermill - - - 
the guys at the papermill - - - no no no ! 
i ' m the head of the company ? ! 
no , i ' m a regional manager - - - 
no - - - my - - - ok , this is insane . you can get out of here . get out ! 
that ' s insane . we ' ll give this to somebody who will appreciate it . 
doesn ' t matter . out please ! 
yeah , well i ' m calling the ungrateful bi - atch hotline ! [ to chad lite ] did you get all that ? 
we gotta do something . [ exhales ] this is spinning out of control , pam . this is just , not . . . 
no , then newsweek picks it up . and then cnn does a story about it . then . . . youtube gets a hold of it . . . 
you ' re right . it will blow over . but it ' s not . . . going to take . . . a week or two . [ pulls out a video camcorder from his desk ] do you know what this is for ? 
 [ dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into michael ' s hair ] ok , i think that ' s good . 
 " hello . i am michael scott , regional manager of dunder mifflin scranton . by now you are probably sick of hearing about dunder mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner . let me tell you something . something from the heart . i am not leaving this office . it will take a swat team , to remove me from this office , and maybe not even that . " 
that ' s how devoted i am to this job . 
i know . 
i understand that , dwight . 
do you think you ' re taking it a little . . . literally , dwight ? and now we ' re wasting tape . i ' m gonna have to cut this all out . can you say cut ? 
so i ' ll know where - - - 
i ' m asking pam to do it , please . 
ok , ready ? 
five , four , three . " there is no way , i will resign . it wouldn ' t be fair . not to the good workers i work with , not to my clients , and especially not to me . let ' s not forget who this whole resigning business is about , anyway . if i could leave you with one thought , remember . . . it wasn ' t me . they ' re trying to make me an escape goat . if i am fired , i swear to god , that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the f - word on it . the f - word . you have one day . " 
that ' s . . . they always give an ultimatum . 
good , cut ? 
thought so too . 
the key to a crisis is dealing with it right away . like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles . if you don ' t act fast , you will lose customers . 
with dissatisfied clients , it doesn ' t matter what you did . all they wanna hear is that you ' re sorry . they ' re like women that way . and this client is a woman . so when i say i ' m sorry , it will be twice as effective . 
so we ' re good ? 
i ' m sorry . 
okay . 
all right . we are infinitely sorry . 
you understand ? you . . . you get this check . 
the customer is always right . mrs . allen was our customer . she was wrong . is that a contradiction ? no . because she ' s not our customer anymore . 
hey , mom . happy birthday , belatedly . sorry i forgot . i had put it on my calendar and pam threw that out . 
and without denying the seriousness of the situation , i would just like to remind you that in much of the netherlands , swimming naked is the norm . so in norway , you ' d be the weirdos . 
are we ready ? 
okay . am i shiny ? 
okay . we good ? okay , that ' s enough aqua net . 
 [ clears throat ] stop it . 
i have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this , and there are still calls for me to resign . calls from an annoying woman , and possibly even the media alike . well let me tell you something , something from the heart . i will not resign . i need this job . my mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month . with this job , i can barely cover that . i have a company car , but i still have to pay for gas , and gas prices are high . and i have no savings whatsoever . and it wasn ' t even me . it ' s so not fair that they want me to resign . 
what ' s happening ? 
really ? is she ok ? 
ok . [ deep breath ] phyllis , you say ? [ snorts ] hmm . [ suppressed laugher ] 
um . . . i mean did he even see pam ? or , uh . . . karen from behind ? 
 [ laughing softly ] i ' m sorry . it ' s pretty funny when you think about it . 
oh , ok . masters of comedy . a guy dropped his pants . have you ever been to the circus ? [ everyone glares ] ok . [ michael puts his finger through his pant ' s zipper ] he ' s back ! [ laughs ] ok . hmm . [ babbling with his coat pulled closed ] waagh ! [ flashes everyone ] 
what ? oh . [ makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down ] 
oh , phyllis got flashed . it ' s , uh . . . [ laughs ] 
oh , come on . we are laughing at phyllis , but she ' s not even here , so no harm , no foul . 
incidentally , where were you during all of this ? maybe you ' re the flasher . 
uh - huh . prove it . let ' s see your penis . [ everyone is shocked ] [ exhales ] i . . . you know , as that was coming out of my mouth , i knew that it was wrong . 
in all the excitement , i forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe . women can ' t have fun if they don ' t feel safe . for example , jan and i have a safe word in case things go too far . foliage . and if one of us says that word , the other one has to stop . although last time . . . she pretended she didn ' t hear me . 
huh ? 
i don ' t know . i feel . . . i drive a lot . i ' m spending a fortune on gas and tolls - 
um , that . . . i don ' t know . that makes me kind of uncomfortable . 
i . . . uh , well , i don ' t know . 
 [ exhales ] i am sick over this thing . those people out there are clearly afraid . and that can ' t happen . not in my house . 
ok . 
this is the last thing that phyllis needs to see right now , dwight . 
dwight , are those your pants ? that ' s a polaroid . [ dwight takes the polaroid and crumples it in his hand ] 
attention , everybody . dwight has something he would like to say . 
ok , you know something , dwight ? we are not the terrorists . why don ' t you just take these women , put ' em in a burlap sack , and hit ' em with a stick ? because that ' s what you ' re doing . i celebrate these women . they deserve the right to dress as they please . if pam wants to show more cleavage , she should be able to . i encourage that . 
see ? that ' s what we ' re talking about . did you hear that , dwight ? 
no , dwight . respect . r - e - s - p - svee - t . find out what it means to me . all right , you know what ? that ' s it . conference room , five minutes . women ' s appreciation . 
oh , i don ' t know , james . did i come from a woman ? have i slept with a woman ? more than one ? 
that is not current . 
you know what ? i am the expert . i will conduct it . i know the crap out of women . 
i , um . . . would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter . 
nobody likes to be flashed . when meredith flashed me at that christmas party , i nearly vomited . 
ok , no catfights . please . let ' s - my point is . . . my point is . . . a penis , when seen in the right context , is the most wonderful sight for a woman . but in the wrong context , it is like a monster movie . 
what are . . . ? shut it . shut . up . ok , so what i want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women ' s problems and issues and situations . magazines and tv shows and movies portray women as skinny , tall goddesses . well , look around . are women like that ? no . no , they are not . [ points to pam ] even the hot ones aren ' t really that skinny . so what does that say ? that says that you women are up against it . and it is criminal . society doesn ' t care . society sucks . i don ' t even consider myself a part of society . fyi . because i am so angry over all of this . 
yes . thank you . that was not necessary , but i appreciated it . and i proves my point . women can do anything . 
no . i ' m being misogynistic . that is insane . i am not being sexist . 
yes . 
because wha . . . that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut . 
i have to know whether you ' re serious or not . 
ye - ok , yes . 
you ' re right . you ' re right , you ' re right . and you know why ? it ' s because of where we are . this is a masculine environment . we need to find a place where you feel comfortable . you know where we ' re gonna go ? the steamtown mall . [ kelly gasps ] 
ok , let ' s go , ladies of dunder - mifflin . hey , we should have a calendar printed up . pam , put that in my good idea folder . [ pam nods ] let ' s go ! 
 [ meredith parking the car ] i don ' t think she ' s gonna make it . don ' t think she ' s gonna make it - [ metal scraping ] 
many women are competent drivers . [ scraping ] ok . come on . 
all right . hope nobody ' s on a diet . 
you ' re welcome . you ' re welcome , you ' re welcome . ok . so , let ' s dish . 
anything you guys want . this is your time . [ everyone is silent or continues to eat , michael exhales ] mm . what is a pap smear ? or is it " shmear ? " like the cream cheese . 
what , um . . . what do you think of role - play ? 
yeah ? well , jan has this schoolgirl fantasy . 
i just . . . i feel uncomfortable wearing the dress . 
jan says anything that doesn ' t scare us is not worth doing . i don ' t know . maybe we ' re different people . i like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex . 
 [ groans ] and then watching it back right afterward to improve my form . 
no , it ' s not that bad . the worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it . 
no , she ' s . . . she ' s fooling around . it ' s a woman thing . 
no . . . no , it ' s all right . i ' m ok . i ' m ok . [ sniffing ] you guys . . . what are we gonna do about jan ? [ sighs ] 
ok . jan is smart . uh , successful . good clothes . hot . perfect skin . nice butt . 
cons . wears too much makeup . breasts : not anything to write home about . insecure about body . i ' m unhappy when i ' m with her . flat - chested . 
she ' s totally flat . shrunken chesticles . 
i ' m unhappy when i ' m with her . 
i ' m happy sometimes . um . . . when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex . 
yeah , that ' s smart . 
that sounds good too . i don ' t know who ' s right . i just don ' t - i don ' t know . i don ' t know . 
i wanna break up with jan . wow . i wanna break up with jan . 
wow , i cannot believe this yogurt has no calories . 
oh , hey , guys . i want to do something nice for you , because you did something so nice for me earlier . i want you to go in there . i want you to buy one item on me as a thank - you . [ kelly sprints inside victoria ' s secret ] come on . get in here . 
let ' s face it , most guys are from the dark ages . they ' re caveman . and they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8 - inch heels , and to be wearing , um , see - through underpants . but . . . for me , a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked . 
mm . you don ' t want anything ? my treat . some panties or . . . pick a thong or . . . g - string . t - back . get a nice bra . padded bra . see - through , push - up , lace ? thigh - high ? bustier ? any - it just - you know what , i would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear . 
oh . oh , no . [ inhales sharply ] it ' s jan . what do i do ? 
ok , it stopped . 
uh , yeah . yep . um . . . could somebody grab me the lever , and i will . . . 
yeah , get your hazards on for safety . let ' s see . [ takes off his coat and tosses it aside ] there we go ! [ pam brings over the jack and lug wrench ] good . yes , we have the . . . all right . [ tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts ] 
do you have a . . . a crescent ? a crescent allan ? 
uh . . . you know what ? i ' m going to . . . you take care of that . i ' m gonna do traffic . . . detail . 
ok , i am really going to do this . 
you know what ? i need my girls with me . pam , karen , even phyllis . come on . let ' s do this . let ' s do it . [ sighs ] 
i love you guys . now i ' m getting her voicemail . 
 [ leaving a message ] hey , jan . it ' s me , michael . i ' m just calling to say that i think we need a little break , permanently . and , uh , i know everybody says this , but i - i wanna remain friends . or at least business associates who get along . oh , just so you know , it ' s not me , it ' s you . [ jan walks in ] ok , buddy . somebody just walked in . i have to go . um , so i ' ll talk to you later . 
thank you . 
abso - fruit - ly . 
no . . . no . . . 
yeah . 
maybe some italian . [ voice on phone ] " . . . to remain friends . or at least business associates - " [ jan takes the phone away from her ear ] chinese ? [ voice on phone ] " who get along . oh , just so you know , it ' s not me , it ' s you . ok , buddy . " 
 [ sighs ] any man who says he totally understands women is a fool . because they are un - understandable . there ' s a wishing fountain at the mall . and i threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish . i wished for jan to get over me . i wished for phyllis , a plasma tv . i wished for pam to gain courage . i wished for angela , a heart , and for kelly , a brain . " michael , how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them ? " you mean , how can i be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional ? well , maybe i learned something from women after all . 
love it . 
uh , yes , i am . 
uh , yeah , it ' s okay . its just , i don ' t think the cartoons are very funny . 
the a cartoon that goes with each article . this one says mel karmazin ? i don ' t , i don ' t know . i guess i get it . 
we should really start recycling . 
orgasms , why can women have them ? yep ? 
sometimes i imagine what it would be like to be a woman . i have a full - length mirror in my bathroom , and before i get dressed i will tuck myself between my legs just to see . and , um , it ' s uncomfortable . so maybe i do understand . 
i got shotgun . damn it . 
look at that ! come on ! free underwear ! 
hey , pam , how bout something like that for you . could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section . just show off the twins a little bit . 
idiot . 
i learned a lot about women today . and any man who says he totally understands women is a fool . because they are un - understandable . jan and i broke up . why ? because she didn ' t like one message i left on her voicemail ? but that is her peariagative . i thought i understood women , but maybe , can ' t believe i ' m gonna say this , maybe , women don ' t understand themselves . 
ughh . . . blech . 
just . . . all over . i don ' t want to do anything . . . i ' m dying . . . 
right there . [ michael points to computer screen . ] 
maybe . 
not it . i don ' t have eggs . 
that ' s possible . 
uh - huh ? 
the cfo ? ohh . . . 
ok , everybody out . out . out . out . ok . 
to what do i owe this great honor , david wallace ? 
and gromit . [ david sighs ] jan ? is jan there ? 
oh , you sigh like jan . i broke jan ' s heart , david , and it was awful . it was . . . it was never my intention to ruin a life . but you know what ? sometimes . . . 
 . . . you just gots to get your freak on . 
yeah . 
hmmm . 
really ? 
wow . i wish i had prepared something to say . 
may god guide you in your quest . 
ok , everybody have their towels and swim suits ? we have about an hour and half . i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus . 
oscar , you brought your speedo , i assume ? 
well , you can ' t swim in leather pants . [ laughs ] i ' m just yankin ' your chain . not literally . 
oh , you know what ? uh , you ' re not going . 
yeah , i know . i ' m sorry , toby . we . . . um . . . somebody has to stay here . 
i want today to be a beautiful memory . . . that the staff and i share after i have passed on to new york . and if toby is a part of it . . . then it ' ll suck . 
hey pam , i have a very important job for you 
we are . we are . but , i would like you to take notes . and i want you to find out about people ' s character . not their hotness , per se , but their humor , and their charisma , and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me . 
what happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away ? i will answer your question with a question . it ' s like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away . it dies . unless you find a new head . i need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head . 
i want you to write down everything that people are doing all day . and then type it up , in a way that is helpful . alright ? 
this way to the partay bus . 
everybody , may i have you attention please ? today , we are not just spending a day at the beach . 
if you don ' t like it , stanley , you can go to the back of the bus . 
or the front of the bus . or drive the bus . just , we are all participating in mandatory fun activities . funtivities ! and there is a special secret prize for the winner ! 
okay , you know what ? your enthusiasm ' s turning people off . 
well , [ whispering ] hey pam , did you get that down ? 
like everything i said and everything they did and . . . just don ' t . . . 
well write it down before you forget it . that ' s . . . you ' ve just been drawing pictures . [ sighs ] rrrr . i can ' t stay mad at you . 
here we are ladies and gentlemen . everybody ready ? last one down is a rotten egg . [ gets off bus ] watch out for snakes ! 
alright , find a cozy spot . everybody settle in . [ everybody sits down on beach ] ok , everybody up ! circle ' round . [ motions for circle to form ] let us play some games . we are situated on the northeast corner of scenic lake scranton . america ' s eighth largest indigenous body of water . it is here that a group of americans will undergo the ultimate challenge . one day , 14 strangers who work together , but only one survivor . 
just words . inspiring words . [ under breath ] not a contender . [ out loud ] for the competitions , you will be divided into four tribes . each tribe will have a leader that i will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking . jim , dwight , andy and stanley . 
choose your tribes . except for pam . not pam . 
jim halpert . pros : smart , cool , good - looking . remind you of anybody you know ? cons : not a hard worker . i can spend all day on a project , and he will finish the same project in a half an hour . so that should tell you something . 
i ' m not playing . 
dwight is an obvious candidate for my job . he has the best sales record in the office . he loves the work . he is , however , an idiot . 
we are going to choose team names . dwight ? 
hey , hey , hey . ok , ok . . . stanley , your team name ? 
then i will name your team the red team . 
i am also considering stanley because of all the good that black people have done . for america . 
very good . pam , please take a note that andy is patriotic . 
andy bernard . pros : he ' s classy . he gets me . he went to cornell . i trust him . cons : i don ' t really trust him . 
it is time for the great spoon and egg race . this one is with a little twist . 
shh . . . the person carrying the egg will be blindfolded . please put on your blindfolds . that person carrying the egg will go down , circle a torch , come back , deposit their egg in the pail . first team back is the winner . alright . ready ? set . go ! [ contestants start walking ] 
 [ off screen ] pam . . . you ' re missing things . [ shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook ] 
okay pam , i have another little project for you . 
smart as a whip ! yes ! [ holds up hot dog packages ] these are pre - cooked , so it ' s not absolutely necessary , but i would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest i ' m going to be having . i would greatly appreciate it . 
like umm . . . [ looks at watch ] ten minutes ? 
thanks a bunch . 
a good manager has got to be hungry . hungry for success . 
ok , who ' s hungry [ kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth ] no , no , no . do not touch the food . please . not yet . that is our next event . a hot dog eating contest . [ sighs at the table ] for those of you who are curious , the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs . wow ! and you know what ? i personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record . so shoot for the stars , ok ? alright , the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner . on you mark . get set . 
no , i have the only one . i claimed it . ready ? 
guys , guys , guys . come on ! pleeeeease . . . let ' s just . . . ok , it ' s very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can . on your mark . get set . eat ! 
no mustard , no mustard . just eat it , eat it , phyllis . dip it in the water so it ' ll slide down your gullet more easily . 
come on , the winner gets a big , big prize . 
i can ' t say . 
the winner gets a regional manager ' s salary for a year , and a sebring , and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world . 
the winner of today gets my job . ok ? i ' m interviewing for a job at corporate . and they ' re only interviewing a handful of people and i ' m the most qualified and i ' ll probably get it . alright ? 
i didn ' t want to tell anyway . i didn ' t want to cast a pall over our fun beach day . but you know what ? i don ' t know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up . 
 [ points at stanley ] word . [ stanley starts eating hot dog ] there we go . let ' s see it . 
four . three . two . one . stop your eating ! and the winner is andy bernard , with 14 hot dogs ! 
13 hot dogs , everybody ! 
it ' s very simple . there are only three rules . you must not touch the ground . you must not step outside of the ring . and you must always wear the safety mittens . 
probably left them in the trunk of my car . it ' s alright . it ' s alright . here we go . 
aaaaaand , go ! 
nice , stanley ! 
one . two . three . 
excellent ! 
i knew that finding a successor would be difficult . i did not know that it would be impossible . thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing . uh , jim is not taking it seriously . uh , stanley is having a stroke . and andy , where is he ? where the hell is andy ? where is he , pam ? do you know ? ah . . . who ' s ahead in points ? 
check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook . 
please just check . 
what does a great manager need most of all ? courage . 
your loss , stanley . meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory . walking through fire ! 
who among you has the guts to replace me ? let him walk across these coals . 
no . no , not you , pam . you have to keep score . 
pointless . 
blah , blah , blee blup , blup , okay ? this is about guts . it takes guts to be a regional manager . jim , you ' re up . 
ji . . why not ? c ' mon . 
you do not have what it takes to be a regional manager . 
who ' s next ? andy ? where ' s andy ? andy is never here today . 
because i already did . remember ? i burned my foot on a george foreman grill . 
alright . okay . alright . fine . ' kay . [ clears throat , breathes noisily ] the mind has to wrap around the foot . [ exhales ] okay . 
yes . count to three , please . 
count the other way . count . . . no , no , count one , two , three , not three , two , one . 
wait ! am i going on go ? or am i going on three ? 
okay . 
don ' t , don ' t . 
i ' m not going to give it to you . 
being the boss is also about image . i ' ve never looked like that . that was gross . i just , i don ' t see the connection between a firewalk and management . worst seventy - five bucks i ever spent . you know what , if i had to pick my replacement based on today , it would be mr . " outside hire . " 
yeah . ummm , hmm . . . true . look , i don ' t want to leave this branch that i love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round . to test the aspect of my job that i think is the most important , something i call the bob hope factor . 
god ! he ' s a comedian . 
who ' s amanda bynes ? 
oh , i love that movie . yes , kelly is right , the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope . so without further ado , jim and dwight show us what you got . 
you are being too modest . 
hhhh . . . okay . that is not funny . i am deducting sixty points from voldemort for false pretenses . okay , dwight your turn . wow us . 
that is a very , very funny story . 
pam , that was amazing . but i am still looking for someone with a sales background . 
wwwwiiiillllmmmmaaaa ! 
so we have about an hour and a half . i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus . fun on wheels . only way to travel . besides a monorail . 
no . no , no , no . no guests today . classic gang only . just us good friends , and karen and andy . 
pam , you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together . how did that work out ? 
acrimonious . 
this way to the party bus . good . 
it ' s a bus that takes you to a party . here we go . 
here we go . come on . okay , everybody here ? 
then , mr . driver , we are off like a herd of turtles ! johnny carson . [ meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup ] 
nothing . 
no . 
no ! 
no . 
no , we are not . 
you are really annoying me . if you don ' t knock it off . . . 
 . . . i ' m never gonna tell you anything ever again . stop it ! stop it ! stop it ! 
no . we ' re only 10 minutes from the lake . 
yes , i am choosing my apprentice . which is why i have modeled all my games after survivor . 
any questions ? 
yup . 
yes , for dramatic affect . 
very good , jim . pam , please note that jim is very astute . all right , are we ready ? 
set ! 
go ! 
 [ sighs ] okay . pam , who came out best in the race , in your opinion ? 
because he wasn ' t following the rules . 
but they didn ' t complete their task , pam ! if people can ' t carry an egg in a spoon , blindfolded , then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report , or conduct a business call ? 
exactly . are you sure you ' re doing that right ? taking an awfully long time . 
okay , all right . 
it ' s very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can . . . 
son of a bitch . god ! okay . all right you know what ? here we go . on your mark ! get set ! 
no mustard ! no mustard ! just . . . eat it . eat it , phyllis . dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily . 
no , no , no , no , not that - - - just . . . come on , you guys , let ' s do it ! i ' m serious . who ' s got the hungry ? 
who ' s got the hungry ? 
come on , ryan . . . 
ryan , i want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth . right now . 
 [ dwight and stanley are in sumo suits ] ready ! go ! 
you ? you haven ' t made a sale . 
don ' t try to flirt your way into this . sometimes you really creep me out . 
andy bernard is in first place with four hot dogs ! dwight schrute is a close second with three and a half ! here comes stanley ! here comes stanley , with three hot dogs ! 
this is an inflatable sumo suit . [ blows ] now , in the olden days , when they wanted to find a guy who could be king , they would have him pull a sword out of a stone . well , times have changed . [ blows ] and it ' s not even about who is the best sumo wrestler . it ' s about who is the best boss . and i don ' t even care who wins . [ blows ] it ' s how they wrestle in a blow - up suit . . . [ breathes in ] that will tell me all i need to know [ blows ] or how sumo . . . [ collapses ] 
 [ at dunder - mifflin corporate in ny ] david ! 
are we all set ? 
yes . i just happened to be in the neighborhood , thought i ' d drop in and say hello . 
thought i ' d catch a show . 
naaah . you know what ? since i ' m here , let me ask you a few questions about the job . 
um , how many people are you interviewing ? 
ah , well , good . out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than i have , or manages more people ? 
great . one more . . . question . when you merged those branches who did you put in charge ? 
ah , great . no further questions . 
okay . 
and i ' m really looking forward to working with you . 
i got it made in the shade . i know this company . the other branch managers are total morons . [ on cell phone ] hey , pam yeah , i forgot what day the interview was and i drove to new york accidentially . i ' ll be like three hours late . 
 [ knock on door ] yeah . 
yes , the time has come to name my own replacement . so please hand this letter of congratulations to dwight k . schrute . 
okay . uh . . . 
uh , okay . 
stop crying . 
ohhhhh . . . 
why so you can do it ? 
no , um , well i was thinking that uh , actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know ? convoys are really fun . pull up next to each other , give each other the finger . . . 
moon each other . 
all right . 
your loss . 
cruise control . 
there they are , the accounting department . i shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks . 
no . not at all . i haven ' t talked to jan since we broke up , and i think if she had something to say she would have called me . 
no , no , no . you know what ? it ' s a done deal . i basically have the job already . there ' s nothing she can do to stop it now . i already sold my condo . 
yes , i . . . 
i have to buy another place . 
i sold it on ebay . the buyer was very motivated , as was i . it went for eighty percent of what i paid . sold in record time . 
who is d . abramson ? 
why . . . are you here ? 
i ' m good . how are you , janet ? it ' s good to see you . 
why privately ? 
okay , sure , fine . um , why don ' t you wait in my office . i have some important business matters to take care of . 
okay . 
pam , defcon ten . houston , we have a problem . 
uh , i may need some immediate assistance . if you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room . phyllis , angela , karen . 
no . she ' s an alternate . 
so , how you been ? 
good . 
yeah . 
weird . yeah , i didn ' t get both of your messages . 
hmm . 
sound good . sounds fun . 
hmm . . 
would you excuse me for a second ? 
defcon twenty . she wants to get back together . 
i don ' t know , that ' s why you ' re here , help me . please . . . 
no , no . what do i do ? 
what if she makes me ? 
she made me do a lot of things i didn ' t wanna do . 
i wasn ' t . 
you ' re right . you ' re absolutely right . i ' m gonna go in there and tell her that we can ' t be together . 
wow . 
i ' m in a very good place right now . thank you . 
 [ walks back into office with jan ] okay . [ clears throat ] jan , we need to talk . [ jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged ] 
jan is in a different place right now , and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances . so i am going to hear her out . 
yeah . 
first got priorities . 
let ' s get back together . [ jan smiles and laughs ] 
no . no , no , no , no . i ' ll tell you this , it is not because of the boob job . excuse me , boob enhancement . that would be shallow . and this is the opposite of shallow . this is . . . emotionally magnificent . 
 [ holding jan ' s breasts ] remarkable . 
wait , wait . check one more time . 
very good [ jan nods ] 
yes , indeed . 
so , i guess we ' re getting back together . 
your advice was good , but jan ' s was bigger . 
here ' s the sitch . two weeks ago , i was in the worst relationship of my life . she treated me poorly . we didn ' t connect , i was miserable . now , i ' m in the best relationship of my life with the same woman . love is a mystery . 
hey , everybody . the next time you see me , i ' ll be working for corporate . starting tomorrow , dwight schrute will be running the branch . so without further ado , [ clicks on small tape player ] i would like to start saying my goodbyes [ song : thank you , by natalie merchant plays in background ] okay . goodnight , and good luck . 
 [ exhales ] how are you guys doing ? need anything ? 
i have been here a bunch of times , so i know where everything is , know everybody ' s names . if you need to know somebody ' s name , just ask me . 
that is beardy . 
mm - hmm . 
no , no , no , just . . . that ' s not his real name . that ' s just what i call him , so . . . 
i am by far the most qualified person they ' re interviewing . jim and karen are here , which is cute . they ' re like , kid actors tagging along with daddy , on the big audition , hoping to be discovered . except daddy . . . is the best actor around . daddy is meryl streep . 
hey ! hunter ! wha ' s up my brutha ? this is hunter , secretary extraordinaire . 
jan in yet ? 
could you give her a message for me , when she gets in ? 
just say , " i want to squeeze them . " it ' s code . she ' ll know what it means . 
oh , and hunter ? could you tell her , [ michael shakes his head and makes the " motorboat " noise ] " brbrbrbrbr ! " also ? 
 [ knocks on door ] hello , hello ! 
good to see you . here are the post - merger performance stats that you asked for . 
why don ' t i tell you what my greatest weaknesses are ? i work too hard . i care too much . and sometimes i can be too invested in my job . 
well , my weaknesses are actually . . . strengths . 
thank you . 
i ' ve never been a big fan of the name dunder mifflin . i was thinking we could name the company something like , " paper great . where great paper is our passion . we ' re grrrrrrrrrreat ! " i don ' t know , could be good . or , uh , " super duper paper . it ' s super duper . " i don ' t know , something like that . 
okay . 
thank you . 
it is always a treat when our paths cross . so , oh ! before i forget , i wanted to let you know , if you hadn ' t already heard , uh , jan and i are back together . so . . . i may need to fill out one of those love documents again . 
yes . and i am very excited about the prospect of working under her . . . or on top of her . [ laughs ] mm , that ' s not sexual , just . . . we ' re all professionals . 
i don ' t understand . so , we ' re gonna tag team it ? 
hey . 
pretty good . 
could have gone better i guess . 
cool . maybe you should do it sooner rather than later . 
daaah , let ' s just run away together . let ' s just run away to jamaica and live in a bungalow . you have some savings right ? you could pay off my debts . it would . . . be fine . we ' d have fun . 
i can ' t tell you . 
wuuuoooh , hey , whoa , jan - - - 
hey ! you ' re unstable ! 
no - - - we ' re all unstable . 
david , i did not tell her . 
so , i am gonna . . . give her a ride home . let me know about the job . 
good , i ' m glad we ' re on the same page . i have a lot of ideas for new directions . 
you know what ? that . . . is actually good . . . because , um , i don ' t think i could take . . . my girlfriend ' s job . that ' s not being a good boyfriend . so , i respectfully withdraw my name from consideration . do you accept my withdrawal ? 
good . very good . i ' m glad we are finally on the same page . still have my job in scranton , though . 
good . that ' s all i ever wanted . these two . [ points at jim and karen ] either one of them . . . excellent candidates . 
i know . i know , i ' m sorry about that . that was terrible . 
well , it ' s . . . [ jan starts crying , high pitched whining ] no , don ' t cry , it ' s gonna be ok . 
 [ whispers ] i don ' t know . [ normal volume ] well i guess . . . you could come and stay at my condo . i think i could back out of the sale . [ jan exhales ] probably get some negative feedback on my ebay profile . 
 [ in the office , imitating the terminator ] i ' ll be baaaaack ! and i am baaaack ! 
no . no , pam . i ' m baaaaaack ! for gooood ! kevin nealon . 
everybody , may i have your attention please ? it is with great honor and privilege that i announce to you that i have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job . i know , i know , i know . " michael , what are you thinking ? you were a shoe in . " well , got down there . i nailed the interview . and the strangest thing happened . why is my office black ? 
that ' s stupid . 
you shouldn ' t have taken it . bad management ! good thing i ' m baaaaaack . [ laughs ] ryan , coffee . 
no , it ' s for me , bimbo . kids . 
so i ' m back . and i am never , ever going to leave . i am going nowhere . this place . . . is like . . . the hospital where i was born , my house , my old age home , and my . . . graveyard . . . for my bones . 
 [ to everyone ] back to work . [ to ryan ] still waitin ' on that coffee . 
well , [ clears throat ] i ' ve actually done a lot of thinking about that . and in ten years , i am living in a big house , with my kids . and in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and i have a remote that works everything , that has like a belt - loop attachment , or in my ear , like a gluetooth . and , because it ' s the future , i can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day . 
well , i don ' t know what it ' s gonna be called , but . . . my point is , the future of this company is now . and the future . . . is me . 
jan got fired . and i realized that i could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend . but more than that , i realized that . . . i couldn ' t take a job that would take me away from this place . this is where i belong . this is . . . my home . and home is where the hardest . 
heart is . that makes a lot more sense . you think they ' d help each other out like that at corporate ? [ oscar shrugs ] i think not ! 
new york real estate . i started by looking for a brownstone , like the huxtables had , [ shakes head ] but instead i found this very , very , nice place in jamaica , queens , mon . it is on the last stop of the subway , which is wonderful , because if i fall asleep , i still end up at home . it is a suh - weeeet one bedroom . i have a roommate , uh , vijay chokalingham , he ' s a sophomore at queens college . he actually works in the indian restaurant right below the apartment , so . . . free food , and the place always smells like curry . so , win / win . 
ok , well i did not get the job in new york , but i got the real prize , domestic bliss . jan made me breakfast this morning . . . well she bought the milk . it ' s soy . [ walks into bedroom , jan sleeping on bed ] this is why i do it , that ' s what i have to come home to . [ sighs ] she probably won ' t be up for a few hours . 
this is going to be a very good year . very good . jan is at home . jim is back . my protege ryan is at corporate . good stuff . um . . . andy and dwight are rockin ' the sales team . i feel very blessed . [ slams on breaks , camera turns , meredith rolls off the hood ] 
ladies and gentlemen . i have some bad news . meredith was hit by a car . 
it happened this morning in the parking lot . i took her to the hospital , and the doctors tried to save her life . they did the best that they could . . . and she is going to be ok . 
yes . she has a slight pelvical fracture , but , ah . . . people have survived far worse . 
yeah . 
gah . kind of a good news bad news there . i was able to be on the scene so quickly because i was in the car that hit her . 
yeah , it ' s only meredith , thank god . but did you see the way they looked at me ? like i was a murderer or something . 
it was an accident . 
no . 
my lord my liege . 
so ryan got promoted to corporate , where he is a little fish in a big pond . whereas back here in scranton i am still top dog , in a fairly large pond . so who is the real boss ? the dog or a fish ? 
so i need a little treat for the gang . something to win their affections back . 
well , i ran down meredith in my car . 
no , i was being negligent . but she ' s in the hospital , she ' s fine , recovering nicely . tiny little crack in her pelvis . but she will be up in . . . 
yes . it was on company property , with company property , so . . . double jeopardy , we are fine . 
oh , right , i ' m sorry . what is : we are fine ? 
ok , i have an announcement . 
no . 
no ! that is not funny , i love my employees , even thought i hit one of you with my car . for which i take full responsibility . look i ' m just trying to take everybody ' s mind off of this unavoidable tragedy , and onto more positive things . so i thought we should plant a tree . 
so , like a freedom tree . 
pam . 
pam . 
ok , good good , so we ' ll just all go down there together at lunch . 
excellent ! 
good work pam . 
yaaaaaay , pam ! alright , since i am the boss i will drive as well . who wants shotgun ? 
everyone inside the car was fine , stanley ! 
guess what , i have flaws . what are they ? oh , i don ' t know . i sing in the shower . sometimes i spend too much time volunteering . occasionally i ' ll hit somebody with my car . so sue me . . . no , don ' t sue me . that is the opposite of the point that i ' m trying to make . 
eww . i hate hospitals . in my mind they are associated with sickness . oh . . . she looks like an angel . 
no . . . ok , she always looks like that . . . that is not my fault . 
no . . . she ' s in a coma . 
ok . . . meredith , [ hauntingly ] ooooohhhhh . i brought all your friends from the office dear . 
yeah . 
brought you some balloons . why don ' t we . . . here you go . [ wraps them around her iv ] tie these up , cheer up your tubes . . . [ iv pops out ] oh ! shhhh . . . for god ' s sake ! 
nurse . 
 [ groaning ] i am going to be sick . . . i ' m gonna puke . 
oh , ok . . . wait up , wait up , guys guys guys , hold on a second . you know what i was thinking might be sort of fun ? is if you forgave me in front of everybody . 
cause you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness ? forgiveness is next to godliness . 
well , just shhhh . . . just just . . . 
look , i just . . . i don ' t understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug . 
come on . [ starts to climb onto the bed with meredith . 
do i need to be liked ? absolutely not . i like to be liked . i enjoy being liked . i have to be liked . but it ' s not like a compulsive need to be liked . like my need to be praised . 
ok , you know what ? everybody , let ' s just get over the whole meredith thing . she cracked her pelvis , a tiny little crack . she going to be fine , so let ' s just . . . 
sprinkles ? 
 [ sighs ] oh , sh . . . i ' m sorry angela . man what a day huh ? how could it get any worse ? her computer crashes with the porn , and then meredith with the accident , and then . . . sprinkles ! god , that ' s 3 things . i ' ll tell you what ' s going on . this office is cursed , and we need to do something about it . 
well , i am taking responsibility . it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit meredith with my car . i ' m not superstitious , but . . . i ' m . . . i am a little - stitious . 
did anyone do anything involving an indian burial ground ? 
like park on it . or dig up a body . . . toby ? anything you want to tell us ? 
perfect . so our tragedy is your good luck . satan . 
dwight , you haven ' t seen meredith yet , have you ? 
well , i think you should go to the hospital , and pay your respects . 
alright , i would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs . 
satan is a master of lies . everything he says is the opposite . 
thank you for the permission . psych ! alright let ' s just go around the room , and tell me what you believe in . 
ok . 
alright . 
kelly , you are hindu , so you believe in buddha . 
are you sure ? 
what are you ? 
ok , 1 sikh , and . . . 
you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you , and then you run over one person with your car . [ sighs ] and it ' s not even one of the popular ones , and everybody gets on your case . doesn ' t make any sense . . . god is dead . 
maybe believing in god was the mistake . what did people believe in before ? the sun ? maybe there ' s some sort of animal , that we could make a sacrifice too . like a giant buffalo , or some sort of monster , like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion . or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat . or just . . . the head of a monkey , with the antlers of a reindeer , with , ah . . . the body of a porcupine . 
oh god , rabies ? 
i was in the hospital room with her . how contagious is that , is that like an std ? 
this place is so cursed . 
 [ walks out into the office ] i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith ' s life by hitting her , with my car . but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened , dwight endangered her life , by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it . 
turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies . which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis . thanks to me she went to the hospital and i saved her life . curse is broken . curse is broken people ! [ kevin claps ] oh . . . there is a god , and he has a plan for us after all . so go home get some rest , very very good work today . we got a lot accomplished . 
is there a god ? if not , what are all the churches for ? and who is jesus ' dad ? 
pro - am . 
a woman shouldn ' t have to be hit by a car , to learn that she may have rabies . but that is where we are in america . and that does not sit right with me . and that is why i ' m hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies . to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies . a disease that has largely been eradicated in the us . but not very many people know that . 
hi stanley , how many sponsors so far ? 
come on man , gotta step it up ! it ' s for a good cause . jan called this morning and pledged $ 500 . 00 . 
that . . . is for a good cause . phyllis , how ' s the rabies quilt coming ? 
oh , look at that , 3 . way to honor meredith , phyllis . 
yes . 
ok . [ walks away ] 
alright , alright . 
shhh . . . 
i know that you ' re probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts . 
ok , well back in olden times , a large fat person , like this , was a person of power . a person who had money , could buy food , person of respect . like the regional manager of the day . whereas , someone athletic and trim , like myself , was someone who worked in the fields . . . and i was a peasant . 
well , you ' re going to have to run , or you ' re going to be in a lot of trouble . it is not olden times anymore . 
we have raised , almost $ 700 . 00 , most of it from me and jan . um . . . when do they put that on the giant check ? or is that something that we write in later ? 
hmm . . . that ' s a tough decision . um . . . i always imagined it with a giant check . so . . . 
yep . 
you didn ' t contribute very much . i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor . and how ' s that been going ? 
what about a rabies nurse ? 
that ' s possible . look into that . 
have you met that kid ? he ' s not going to college . 
come in . 
hey , hey , hey 
what are you doing ? 
no i didn ' t , just please don ' t . . . 
may i enter the room ? 
see how i did that . that ' s the way you should enter a room . you knock and then you wait for the all clear . 
yes , but i have an office , so why would i do that . 
european offices are naked all the time . 
besides my shirt tail covered most of it so . . . 
that ' s not gross , it is the human body . what is your problem ? pam you ' re an artist , right ? think of me as one of your models . ok , you know what , i don ' t want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today , it ' s not fair to people with rabies . and that ' s the point , right ? ok , let ' s go have some fun . 
check that out . [ points to toby ] look at me , i ' m toby , i ' m stretching , i know what i ' m doing . why is he even here ? 
ok everybody , listen up . thank you for coming . before we get started i wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies . and i ' d like you to take a look into the face of rabies . [ turns around a picture of meredith in the hospital ] that should scare you . it scares me . you people need to educate yourselves . myth : 3 americans every year die from rabies . fact : 4 americans every year die from rabies . how many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies ? show of hands . one , two , three . . . too many to count . it is truly the silent killer . no , it is the foaming barking killer . and it is something . . . darryl what are you doing . 
no , don ' t give him . . . just , did you hear anything i said ? 
he ' s happy because he ' s insane . you know what , that ' s the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate . where ' s the nurse ? [ elizabeth walks up in nurse ' s outfit ] this is the reason we ' re here . 
oh hey , i know you . . . elizabeth ? 
right ? wow , very cool you went back and got your degree . i would like you to accept this check , for $ 340 . 00 made out to science . make sure that , that gets into the right hands . 
you got it ? 
ok , fettuccine alfredo , time to carbo - load . 
just remember folks , it ' s not about winning , it is about finishing . 
 [ pulls toby ' s pants down ] beow ! 
on your left ! 
i am fast ! i ' m very fast ! i ' m like forrest gump , except i am not an idiot . [ creed , stanley , and oscar get into a cab ] 
no , no water for me . not while rabies causes fear of water . . . solidarity ! 
rabies victims . . . have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives . so . . . least i could do . 
that fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock . 
 [ laughs ] excellent ! . . . simpsons . wait , imodium or ex - lax ? 
 [ burp ] oh god , oh , alfredo sauce . i ' m getting a stitch . [ groans ] 
 [ runs by ] take bat bites seriously . don ' t get bit . 
 [ bent over ] i am not going to finish . i can ' t beat rabies . nobody can beat rabies , rabies has been around for a thousand years . i was a fool to think that i could beat it . [ creed , stanley , and oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line ] 
i can ' t finish . i feel so weak , i just . . . 
what do you want me to do jim ? 
no , there are people all over the world , who have all sorts of problems and afflictions , and diseases . they ' re deformed , and they ' re abnormal , and . . . they ' re illiterate and ugly . symphonies don ' t have any money . public tv is bust . i can ' t do anything about it , i can ' t . . . you know . there ' s just one of me , and there ' s a thousand of them . and rabies wins . 
that ' s a good deal . 
pam , if everybody felt that way , nothing would get done . 
you just don ' t think i am capable , of making a difference . 
you don ' t , you don ' t know me . you ' ve just seen my penis . i can make a difference , remember , i ' m the one who started this whole thing off by hitting meredith with my car . and i owe it to her to finish this . . . gd 5k [ gets up groaning , jim tries to help ] no , no ! 
finishing that 5k , was the hardest thing i have ever had to do . i ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water , than i have in my entire life . people always talk about triumphs of the human spirit , well today i had a triumph of the human body . that ' s why everybody was applauding for me at the end . my guts and my heart , and while i eventually puked my guts out , i never puked my heart out . and i ' m very , very proud of that . 
hey mer . how ya doing ? 
it ' s ironic isn ' t it ? i mean i ' m in the hospital for not getting enough water , and you ' re in it for a disease that causes the fear of water . 
thanks , i ' m not mad at you anymore . [ sighs , takes sucker out of his mouth ] wanna share ? 
i ' m not really sick . [ meredith takes a lick and hands back to michael ] nah , i ' m good . 
did you ever think of this ? would a sober person walk in front of a car ? 
well . . . 
that ' s not . . . 
that ' s not what . . . no , no , i ' m not saying that , that ' s disgusting . 
i am saying . . . that . . . maybe i was drunk . did you ever think of that ? 
okay . 
maybe she hit me . you ever think of that ? she hit me ? i don ' t know whose fault it was . i wasn ' t exactly looking at the road . 
you know what , why don ' t go around the room and say one memory of meredith . i ' ll start . i liked her jumpers . they reminded me of kindergarten . jim ? 
hey ! okay , okay , okay , you can just close that . 
let ' s just . . . why can ' t you just forgive . . . why , why are you having such a hard time laughing this off ? how do you know that you weren ' t born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point ? 
i ' m not going to leave until you forgive me . 
 [ standing for a while , sighs , turns to walk out ] oh , okay . 
this office is cursed . [ sighs ] and we need to do something about it . 
maybe the conference room , maybe the annex . i ' m just saying , at least right here [ indicates floor in front of his office ] is cursed . conference room , 10 minutes . 
on the one hand , it ' s a relief to know that it ' s not just me , the whole office is cursed . on the other hand , i may have to deal with the dark unknown . 
we have to have done something wrong . 
that was the curse , stanley , and we are trying to find the cause of the curse . 
oscar , are you santaria ? 
oh . great . we have a secular humanist here , that is disgusting . 
yes . it is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition . 
stupid . 
yeah , the , uh , the charity ' s having some financial problems . what do i look like to you , paul newman ? that ' s actually not a good example , because i have been compared to a young paul newman , my eyes and my face . and i make my own salad dressing . i mix newman ' s ranch with newman ' s italian . sell it at flea markets for a slight loss . i could make . . . i could make a profit if i changed one of the ingredients to wishbone [ shakes head ] but i won ' t do it . 
whoa , ' scuse me ! oh ! 
oh , slow ! oh , ho , ho , ho . [ laughing as he passes phyllis and bob ] you guys are going so slow . . . 
come on , i ' m going backwards . 
oh , all right ! all right ! all right ! all right ! 
okay ! [ bob vance and michael in an all - out sprint , michael grunting ] 
thanks . 
well , apparently , my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay . i will be paying out - of - pocket . um . . . i kinda wish i ' d been hit by a car . 
hey , doc ? you forgetting something ? [ pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to michael ] thank you . 
hey toby . what ' s this ? [ holds up memo toby has passed out to the staff ] 
 [ reads memo ] i just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving pda or public displays of affection . 
oh really . 
is this about me and jan ? in my office ? because i will have you know that that was consensual . what we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here . i don ' t think . i don ' t think anyone heard anything . we were very discreet and , and most people had left by that point . so i don ' t think it ' s any of your business . what i think you should do is roll up the memo , real tight . . . 
 [ turns to address jim and pam ] no way . 
woooah ! wow ! 
awesome ! 
you guys ! yes ! yes ! 
oh kay , mind is exploding . get over here . [ gestures to pam to get up ] come on . come here . okay , okay , [ to jim ] stand up . [ jim moves over in chair ] ok , here we go . [ holding both pam and jim ' s hand ] everyone , this is a day that will live in infamy . because today , is the day that jim and pam become one . 
i love you guys , so much . [ hugs jim ] 
no , no , no pam let ' em ring . let the bells of dunder mifflin chime out your love . because this is [ starts to well up ] really good , this is really good . my heart soars with the eagles nest . 
hey . can you make that straighter ? that ' s what she said . 
no . [ tries to hide piece of paper , but pam grabs it ] 
blowing up balloons i thought . 
pam and jim are together . ryan is visiting . only thing that could make this day better is ice cream . 
hey ! 
there he is ! there he is ! he ' s back ! and he ' s with a beard . [ laughing ] he . . . he has facial hair . look at him ! all grown up and no place to go . hello , mr . sunny crockett . i ' m tubs . 
ohh , yeah , let ' s get started because uh , yes , cause uh this is very serious business and umm . . 
 . . . business meeting - - 
that ' s right ! that ' s right ! 
fire guy . don ' t start any fires , ryan . 
look how big he is . look at you , you are so mature and old and little man now . you ' re like our little man . . . 
beard . 
oh , wow ! 
that ' s a little kinky . i don ' t swing that way . 
woooo ! [ laughs ] i think ryan has a gay crush on me . 
yes , everybody , come on . settle town . let ' s get serious here . um ryan , has a very special , important presentation to do , which we will be doing in the conference room in [ looks at ryan ] 10 minutes ? 
sounds good . ok , alright . 
yeah , ryan snapped at me , but there was this twinkle in his eye that i picked up on , which said , " dude , we ' re friends . i ' m doing this for appearances . i am the big boss now . and i have to seem like an ogre . but you know me and you trust me . and we like each other . and we ' ll always be friends . and i would never take you for granted in a million years . and i miss you , man . and i love you . " his words . 
oohh . gimmme , gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme . 
ryan howard everybody . [ starts clapping ] good job . [ everyone gets up to leave ] 
who is ? 
i am not old . you are old . you are like a hundred . 
yeah , kay . i was just . . . after the presentation , just wanted to make sure , that vis - a - vie , that everything in the office is business as usual ? 
yeah , i know i understand . . . we ' re making great strides and we ' re updating , but business as usual , no ? 
good , so , we ' re on the same page ? 
we had a foreign exchange student live with us when i was young . and we called him my brother . and that ' s who i thought he was . um , then he went home to what is now formerly yugoslavia , taking all of my blue jeans with him . and i had to spend the entire winter in shorts . that is what ryan is like . a fake brother who steals your jeans . 
hey . 
 [ holds up blackberry ] hey , what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles ? 
i don ' t want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids . 
oh , i dunno , they ' re launching a big new business plan . new website , blah blah blah . he ' s being a real twerp about it , so , it ' s all about youth , and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people . 
well . . . 
what is that . . . word ? 
so older people have just as many rights as younger people ? 
good , we ' re all here , we can get started . 
have a seat . 
have a seat . like everybody else . 
still my office , ryan . [ ryan sits down ] well , there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today . well , new ideas are fine , but they are also . . . illegal , because they are a form of ageism . what ? yes , i am right . did you know that the age discrimination and employment act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older ? i did . 
hey , shut up toby . look , why do we as a society hate old people so much ? 
no , creed , no they are not . in fact , many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability . like the old lady from titanic . [ points to her picture on the wall ] or the funny things that they can do , like " where ' s the beef ? " [ points to another picture on wall ] [ jim raises his hand ] yeah . 
i was going to put up some new pictures , but umm , all of the ink in the printer was gone . 
 [ puts hand up ] that is me . come on in . [ they shake hands ] who is this old fart ? did you just stagger off the street ? out of a box or something ? who ' s this worthless bag of bones ? well , this guy is none other than one of the founders of dunder mifflin , mr . robert dunder . huh ? [ starts clapping , others join in ] 
sure thing . [ both go out of conference room ] ' scuse me . [ closes door ] 
fine . then i will call david wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt . [ they glare at each other ] 
bob , how old are you ? 
eighty - seven years young . and still active . that is great . did you know , that bob is still a member of the board of dunder mifflin ? 
ah , still sends his own proxy . good for you . 
wow . 
oh , boy . 
great . 
great . 
that ' s great . thank you for coming in . [ starts ushering him out ] robert dunder everybody . [ clapping ] thank you . that was wonderful . do you have a ride ? 
perfect . [ starts closing the door ] 
inspirational . what have we learned ? well , we have learned that you can ' t teach an old dog new tricks , because it ' s illegal , and you will go to jail . [ pam raises hand ] 
no , no . don ' t help him . he doesn ' t need help , pam . [ jim nods head and pam gets up and leaves to help robert dunder , michael shows robert thumbs up ] what a nice guy . 
good night guys . [ staff leaves the office ] 
i disagree , i think it was very valuable . 
i happen to think the old ways of doing business are better . and i can prove it . 
smell that . do you smell that ? 
no , dwight . that smells like good business to me . what i have done here is i have collected all the finest gourmet items that scranton has to offer . 
yes , no ! no , those are for our clients . actually , our exclients . i ' ll explain , later . 
ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and im ' s , but i think he ' s forgetting about the original instant message . letters attatched to baskets of food . 
hey boss , i didn ' t know you were coming in today . 
i am glad that you asked , listen up everybody . in the last year , we have lost seven clients to the big chains . these gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives . we are going to show up at these businesses unannounced , and we are going to win them back . 
with peanut brittle , with macadamia nut cookies , with chocolate turtles , with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what ? that ' s what people like . 
ever since i was a kid people have been telling me i can ' t do things . " you can ' t be on the team " , " you can ' t move on to second grade " . well , now they ' re telling me that i can ' t win back clients using old fashioned business methods . [ shakes head ] we ' ll see about that . and fyi , i eventually aced second grade , and i was the biggest kid in class . 
ok . we ' re gonna split up into teams . jim , phyllis . stanley , dwight . me andy . 
why don ' t we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship ? 
yes ? 
ok , that ' s not helpful phyllis . 
gift baskets are amazing , phyllis . gift baskets are . . . the essence of class and fanciness . they are the ultimate present that a person can recieve . 
fine , i ' m just going to go by myself , and i am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me . [ walks toward the door ] 
no , this is my quest . 
fine . then god speed . to both of us . 
we don ' t need luck . 
but thank you , that was really nice of you to say . 
business to business . the old fasioned way . no blackberrys , no websites . i would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people . 
it is in the body shop . had to have the dent taken out of the hood where i hit meredith . 
i know . so who ' s next ? 
who ? 
 [ places the gift basket on top of the table ] wow , those things are heavy ! there ' s a lot of stuff in there . we have macadamia nut cookies , um , the honey mustard pretzels . have you ever tried focaccia crisps ? 
yes we do . 
well . . . 
mmhmm . 
ok , you know what ? just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch . 
well just , uh enjoy the gift basket . 
alright . 
 [ driving ] that guy was so . . . how can they not know how much better we are ? 
that is true . 
yes , she is nuts . 
how do they know ? how does this know where to turn ? that ' s very impressive . 
and the last guy says " no , hairy body " . 
ah , well it ' s still very good . i bet i know someone who hasn ' t heard that joke . . . your daughter emily . how ' s she doing ? 
she ' s gonna be like eleven this winter ? wow , they grow up so fast . i have a few of my own that i want some day . listen , i don ' t want to take any more of your time , i know you ' re a very busy man . the reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies , and to ask you to reconsider . 
ok , ok ! so you ' ll reconsider ? 
ah . . . . is that all you have to say ? 
look , we want you back . 
well , no . 
no it ' s not . 
why would he come back ? i will tell you , dwight . he would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you ' re definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us . 
look . . . we ' re also coming out with a website soon . it ' s a state of the art thing , it ' ll be up and running , it ' s gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier . 
great , the magic of the gift basket . 
ok , good . don ' t let emily have any of the cajun almonds , she ' s alergic . 
i don ' t get it , i really don ' t get it . i thought this would work . i do everything i had at that guy and nothing . 
that is a very good point , dwight . 
no , it said right , it said take a right . 
maybe it ' s a shortcut dwight . it said go to the right . [ turns right ] 
the machine knows where it is going ! 
the machine knows - - - stop yelling at me ! 
let go , let go of me ! 
 [ watching car get pulled from lake ] you sure you ' re ok ? 
good , that is what ' s most important . 
what a disaster , this whole thing . 
these people just don ' t realize what a gift basket means , they don ' t get it . 
what about that last guy , aaron ? is he a jerk . " i don ' t even know if i want it . they ' re website is so easy " . yeah , well , you can have your technology jackass , look where it got us . 
hang up . [ dwight hangs up ] you know what we ' re gonna do ? we ' re walking back . we ' re walking back to that office and we ' re gonna reclaim our gift basket ! 
we ' re gonna take what ' s rightfully ours ! we ' re gonna take a stand , dwight ! we ' re gonna take a stand ! 
give it back . the gift basket , give it back . 
yeah , maybe we should , maybe we should leave . come on , let ' s leave , but before we leave my wet friend and i are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches ! [ sits on couch ] 
look , my clothes are so wet ! 
it ' s been opened . 
what ' s missing . . . the turtles . where are the turtles ? where are the turtles ? 
where are the turtles ? where are they ? 
may i have your attention please ? this office will not be using any new technology ever , starting now . 
ryan thinks that technology is the answer . well guess what ? i just drove my car into a lake . 
i drove my car into a [ bleep ] lake . why you may ask did i do this ? well , because of a machine . a machine told me to drive into a lake . and i did it ! i did it because i trusted ryan ' s precious technology , and look where it got me . 
exactly ! 
maybe , maybe not , time will tell . but i will tell you one thing . those gift baskets never endangered anybody ' s lives . [ looks at ryan ] game set match . . . point . . . scott . . . game over . . . end of game . 
everyone always wants new things . everybody likes new inventions , new technology . people will never be replaced by machines . in the end , life and business are about human connections . and computers are about trying to murder you in a lake . and to me the choice is easy . 
yes . my old friend ryan howard is coming back today for some big presentation . very , very excited . he is my protege . he is someone that i hand - raised , that i nurtured . um . . . he is like a prime cut of veal whom i nourished with my milk . and now he is also my boss . so , win / win . 
oh , okay . okay . just . . . [ michael takes down banner , clears throat ] well , our old friend ryan howard is back , and we ' re going to give a little presentation about the future of our company . so please listen up . [ awkward pause ] all right . 
you don ' t want me to help ? 
yes ? 
 [ laughs ] um . . . yes , i ' ll be right back ! 
i think i know what ' s going on . ryan believes that there is some sort of special ' boss water ' that he gets to drink now . and there isn ' t . but , um . . . don ' t tell him . don ' t tell him that . i don ' t want to jeopardize our friendship . 
ryan is causing some problems . and you were always good at handling him . what should i do to control him ? 
i know , i know , no , what . . . something else . 
uh - huh . 
good . 
my generation ' s all about hard work and accomplishment . like . . . the moon landing . or vietnam . rolling stones . greatest band ever . 
and still rockin ' , oscar . one of the greatest all - time oldies was a little oriental guy named confucius . he literally invented the ancient chinese secret . here ' s some of his quotes . confucius say , " man who farts in church must sit in his own pew . " confucius say , " man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day . " confucius also say , " virgin like balloon . one prick , all gone ! " 
no , i skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page . which proves that he was old , but he was also hilarious . 
i ' m not . it ' s solitaire . see ? 
blackberry . why would anyone name something like this after a fruit ? you wouldn ' t name an ipod after a fruit . [ drops blackberry on desk ] excuse me while i type on my banana . i ' m gonna go to the orange store and buy an apricot computer . [ thinks ] apple . [ nods ] 
this is going on the outside . the pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner . do not tape those on . 
mmhmm . 
i ' m a little busy right now . could you blackberry me a message ? 
 [ creed is using the toaster as a mirror , and touching up his hair with a sharpie and a comb ] the one advantage to being older is that i know a few things about a few things , and i am young enough to not forget them . and old enough to know the difference between the two . i am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws , but young enough to date college girls . but old enough to know better . i ' m at a perfect age . i could die now . but i won ' t , because i am young . 
and the same thing goes for quarterly reports . they are unreadable . they ' re just numbers and boring and blech . so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic , like if we have a bad quarter , put in a storm cloud ? and . . . when we have a good quarter , fireworks ? or a racecar ? [ everyone groans ] doesn ' t have to be a racecar . use your imagination . 
we have a lot of colored paper here . . . why oh why do we keep printing this on white ? [ screen saver box hits the wall ] 
yeah ! i know . i know . it ' s bland . 
maybe , we could have some sort of riddle ? 
like , something that you have to look for . sort of a " where ' s waldo . " [ screensaver box hits the corner of the screen ] 
 [ everyone gets up and leaves the conference room ] alright . alright . let ' s quit while we ' re ahead . 
that was awesome . thank you . 
some days i am just on fire . what can i say ? 
oh , does he ? 
mmmmmm . okay . attention . earthlings . i have some news . beep beep beep beep , beep beep beep beep beep , beep beep beep beep beep , beep beep beep beep beep , beep beep beep beep . okay . today is the big day that i am heading to new york to attend a party with sushi and important people . on an unrelated note , if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before i leave . thank you . 
and . . . today the dunder - mifflin infinity website officially launches .

well the invitation says vip ' s only . is this how you treat your vip ' s , ryan ? we ' re already in the city . the main part with the buildings . what am i supposed to do ? what do you want me to do tonight ? and if you tell me , that i have to drive back to scranton , to the satellite party , i am going to throw up ! okay i ' m going to throw up . i ' m throwing up . you ' re making me throw up , ryan . 
you know what this is like ? i ' ll tell you what this is like . this is like when the freshmen would throw a party and wouldn ' t let any of the seniors go . 
doesn ' t it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us ? 
yeah . i withdrew too . 
alright who wants to party ? 
ohhh , what ? oh i think i faked oscar out . 
i think i faked stanley out too . who else thought that i was leaving ? and they could all go home early ? gotcha . gotcha . gotcha . well who needs new york ? right ? we can have a killer party right here in scranton . 
nope nope nope no . this is going to be nothing like the party you ' ve been planning . this is going to be good and everybody ' s gonna come . what ' s wrong with dwight ? 
oh hey ! good for you . good for you . scranton power . alright you know what ? angela i ' d like you to come into my office in ten minutes . bring something to write with and something to write on . good . 
this was a pretty disappointing day . it was kind of a slap in the face to realize that i wasn ' t as important as i thought i was to a certain young executive who i cared about . but , you know , i ' m not gonna cry over it . i did that in the car on the way home . 
how we doing on time ? 
good . these are some things that i would like to have happen . 
mmmhmm . 
those are just things . this is how i want it to feel . 
i would like this party to be sexier , cooler , more important . . . 
yes 
uh . . . 
i want it . . . 
i want it to embarrass all other parties . i want it to be a party that the guys in new york watch on the web - cam and say , " wow ! how did they get al roker to come ? " 
yes you can . 
yes you can . i know you can . i wouldn ' t say that if i didn ' t hundred percent believe it . who else could do this ? 
no seriously . is there anyone else who could do it better ? because we don ' t have a lot of time . i ' ll get the pizza ! 
good news . 
guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place , alfredo ? 
same thing . 
you know what ? i don ' t understand when you all talk at the same time . 
pizza by alfredo . 
okay , okay , what ' s better ? a medium amount of good pizza ? or all you can eat of pretty good pizza ? 
 [ sighs , walks back into office ] 
yup . 
you don ' t have to say it like that . 
hey 
right , i have a coupon , so half of sixty - three fifty , and half the tip of sixty - three fifty . 
yeah , i told them on the phone that i was ordering eight pizzas . 
you didn ' t actually think i was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza ? 
okay , it doesn ' t say it anywhere on the coupon , and if it ' s policy , it should say it on the coupon . 
 [ sarcastic shrugging of shoulders ] what do you mean hmm - um ? 
it is your problem . that ' s no way to do business , okay ? i ordered eight pizzas with a half - off coupon , so i would like eight pizzas for half - off . end of story . 
i ' m not giving that to you . 
no , no you ' re not going anywhere . you ' re staying here until we figure this out . 
you know what ? this young man needs to learn that ' s not how you treat people . i don ' t care if it ' s pizza . good business is about respect and accountability and follow through . you don ' t just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody , do you ? dwight , please escort this young man into the conference room . right now , get in the conference room . 
yes you are , yes you are , and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza . please , thank you . 
no , you don ' t even know what stupid is . it ' s about to get all stupid up in here . 
you ready to give me my discount now ? 
okay , what have you been doing in here this whole time ? 
alright , dwight , knock it off . you better think about what you are doing young man . 
no ! i ' m an adult , i don ' t have to think or do anything . you ' re a kid , a little snot - nosed , punk kid who thinks he ' s better than everyone else , because he ' s some hot shot , and you don ' t know anything about sales . so stop being a disrespectful little jerk , okay ? 
yeah sales , you sell pizza . last time i checked that ' s called sales . 
alright stop , stop making him say it ! you just made this worse , a whole lot worse . 
stop talking all at once ! 
let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson ? 
you know what jim , the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions . 
i ' m not kidnapping him , i ' m keeping him until i get what i want . 
i think you ' re over - thinking it . 
yes , is alfredo there ? can i speak to a manager then ? okay , can you tell the manager that i ' m keeping his delivery kid until i get a discount on the eight pizzas i ordered . yes , i know it is not on the coupon . also i would like him to throw in two , three pizzas for our . . . 
trouble . okay , alright . 
he said no . 
no , no . 
mister overdramatic , what ' s up kevin ? 
i ' ll just wave and introduce myself . 
hey , i just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer , so take that [ bleep ] hole . 
hey , have you seen jim ? 
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , what are you doing ? 
hey , hey , hey stop it . stop it now , god . oh my god , oh my god , no , no , no . i kidnapped a kid .

oh my god , oh my god . 
this is michael . 
you ' re breaking up . i can ' t hear you . 
 [ to dwight ] mmm - kay . i want you to go in there , and pay him for the pizzas , and give him a generous tip , no more than ten percent . 
i will open the door . 
and hopefully he will walk out , and the rest is out of our hands . 
yes . 
see ya , drive safely . 
 [ pizza guy flips him off ] okay . 
now we wait , and hopefully nothing happens . 
not now dwight , please , it ' s not the time . 
what a horrible day . 
bluh . 
well , i need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth . i ' d really like some sushi . i was hoping that i would have new york style sushi today . and you know what ? 
i ' m going to get it . 
uh - uh , no , there is only one place where they authentic new york style sushi . 
new york . wanna go ? 
alright , you drive . 
here we go . 
mmm . 
hey , you know what ? [ michael and dwight grab plates of sushi ] come on , come on , let ' s go . 
guilty . 
oh , thanks . this is the guy that beat the computer . 
yeah . 
 [ mocking ryan ] i ' m ryan , and tonight didn ' t go the way that i thought it would , because it didn ' t work out for me , and i ' m very embarrassed . i got egg all over my face . 
i never sold any paper , because i ' m an idiot . 
i made it with my cheese pita . 
i started a fire , i started a fire . 
and i ' m hot , i ' m so hot . that ' s why everybody . . . 
well , it ' s part of it , it ' s just the . . . uhhh . 
wanna head back ? 
what ' s wrong with me ? 
i want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me . [ pam stares and nods ] don ' t avoid this . i know you ' re dying to say it , so just say it . 
what , no . no . okay , bags . i have bags under my eyes , pam . i didn ' t see it at home , i didn ' t see it in the bathroom , i didn ' t see it on any of the city mirrors , but in this light . . . 
the big , free mirrors that the city puts up , on trees and telephone poles ? the big round things . 
yes . i have bags under my eyes , and i can ' t go to new york like this ! what do i do ? what do i do ? 
really ? 
that ' s it ? 
all right ! martha stewart ! you can be martha stewart ' s receptionist ! very good ! i will be tea baggin ' it . nn . . . no . 
 [ tea bags on eyes ] do i feel badly , that nobody out there was invited to a party that i was invited to ? not at all . because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves , someday , they could be invited to a party like this . of course , at that point , i will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into . what are you gonna do ? 
coat ! [ throws coat at pam ] 
steak ! where ' s my steeaaak ? 
get me armani . 
on the phone . 
where ' s armani ? he ' s on the phone . too slow . you are not going to paris . i ' m so much better than you are . [ breaks into laughter ] 
i owe you an apology . 
yeah . it was awesome . big surprise ending . won ' t ruin it for you . 
meryl streep is the bad guy . never see it coming . anyways , if i was mean in any way to you , i am sorry . i just want what ' s best for you , mo chuisle . 
so this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes . people have said i have very pretty eyes . 
i haven ' t heard the same about you . so let ' s just go with mine . 
we already have a sofa . so why do - - - 
it . . . folds up . you ' ve only seen it flat . 
i - - - ok . how much is this going to cost ? 
no - - - don ' t . . . that doesn ' t even mean anything . 
yes . money has been a little tight lately . but , at the end of my life , when i ' m sitting on my yacht , am i gonna be thinking about how much money i have ? no . i ' m going to be thinking about how many friends i have , and my children , and my comedy albums . i mean , i have a yacht , so i obviously did pretty well money wise . 
it ' s just that you say it ' s gonna cost what it costs - - - [ phone rings ] 
put him through . yes . ryan , my man ! 
yes , and thank you for sending that to me . 
okay , yeah , i dunno . i dunno , i think those it guys messed up . 
 [ looking at nothing ] wait , oh , no , here it is , here it is . found it . 
oh ! um , actually , i need the car . 
use to have two cars , traded ' em in , now we ' re down to one . good economic sense . although the new car is a porsche . for her . 
you can not , i have a thing tonight . 
what ? 
oh no , i have a thing tonight . 
how about this weekend ? 
dammit to hell . i - i - ugh , ok . all right . 
you wouldn ' t understand . it ' s a secret . 
i ' m sorry mr . o ' brian , i didn ' t mean to interrupt your dinner . i just have a very exciting offer . my records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight . well , what if i told you that i have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes ? how does that sound ? amazing right ? well , it won ' t be that fast , but it will - - [ notices camera ] - - it will be that easy . 
i just love sales . i love it to death . it ' s as simple as that . and i don ' t get to do it enough as a manager , so i took this second job . i count it as a hobby . some people have golf , or relaxing . 
hey , i just got off the phone , and i was gonna make another call . 
no , they ' re with me , so . . . this is nick figaro , manager to the stars ! 
these meetings are useless . 
very inspirational . [ laughter ] 
or a trained seal . [ laughter ] 
yes , is mr . hudson there ? 
i ' m just calling because you responded positively to the - - - 
 . . . stanley ? 
 [ spanish accent ] senor , are you happy with your - - - 
 [ speaking with a different voice ] have you - - - have you considered satellite television ? 
well your son sounds like he ' s really motivated . i think it ' s crazy the coach won ' t play him frankly . 
you bet . 
look , i know sales , and i had that sale , i just needed a few more minutes - - - 
it is not a waste of our time . 
no . 
vikram doesn ' t have my people skills . 
well , i hope this conversation has helped . 
what did you get tonight ? 
oh , that looks good . 
i am going with the vanilla crisp this evening . 
thank you . 
really ? 
wonder what i would ' ve been back home ? 
i know , but it ' s competitive here . what ' s a dollar worth in your land ? medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something . 
i would ' ve been chief of surgery . . . or a cowboy . 
you know what , here ' s the thing about die hard 4 . die hard one , the original , john mcclane was just this normal guy . you know , he ' s just a normal new york city cop , who gets his feet cut , and gets beat up . but he ' s an everyday guy . in die hard 4 , he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter . in air . you know ? he ' s invincible . it just sort of lost what die hard was . it ' s not terminator . 
i actually wrote a movie . 
i ' m writing one , yeah . 
um , sort of a spy , thriller . . . 
thanks , no , i have work tomorrow morning . 
okay , see you guys . [ sees jan ] hey , how you doin ' ? 
okay . how ' s yoga ? 
wh - why not ? 
okay . 
good night vikram . 
hey , congrats on the bonus . 
i ' m gonna have it one of these nights . 
good night . 
um . . . that wasn ' t much of an introduction . 
ahh , still lame . okay . all right . thank you , ryan , for that wonderful introduction . okay , um , today we ' re gonna be talking . . . about . . . powerpoint ! powerpoint ! powerpoint ! powerpoint ! 
yes i forgot about ryan ' s presentation . and yes , it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me . but you know what else would have been nice ? winning the lottery . 
and the best way to start is to hit start . and up comes the toolbar , that ' s what she said . what we have to do here is go to run , and then you look up to powerpoint . and we are in . we are going to register . you hit register - - - updates are ready . i should update . um , estimated time 12 minutes , so this should take 5 or 10 minutes . 
why ? 
no , i had a really rough night , and my boss can back you up on that . 
my other boss , mr . figaro . 
what i do between 5 : 30 pm and 1 am is no one ' s business but mine and my other business ' . 
it won ' t . 
okay , honestly , it was unlikely i was gonna figure this out anyways . [ kelly laughs ] 
why don ' t you do the presentation , because you know how to do it ? 
huh , okay . 
it ' s whoever , not whomever . 
no , whomever is never actually right . 
not a native speaker . 
well it sounds right , but is it ? 
thank you . 
no one , uh , asked you anything ever , so whomever ' s name is toby , why don ' t you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull . 
i ' ve never done this before . i ' ve never quit anything in my life . so , you are filming history . 
nick , i had a dream last night that i had two full time jobs . one here at the lipophedrazone diet pill company - - - 
and the other i was a regional manager of a small paper supply company called dunder mifflin . 
in this dream i did both of these jobs beautifully , and i loved it , and everybody loved me . but the truth is , i can ' t do this . 
i am . 
i was never in this for the money . but it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me . i tried to live the dream . i tried to have a job , a girlfriend , another job , and i failed . but the good thing about the american dream is that you can just go to sleep , and try it all again the next night . 
hey kevin , you ' re a gambler right ? a rounder , you play the ponies , small horses . 
yeah , i was thinking about doing some gambling myself . you know , just a little bit of money . maybe doubling it , and them doubling it seven more times . i don ' t know , kind of just for fun . i was thinking , do you have tips , or ideas about sure things . like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight , you know , like , like he ' s tied into some crooked dealings , maybe his kid is sick or something . like , who do i call about that ? 
do you know anybody in the mob ? 
okay , um , oscar , i ' m going to need to take another advance on my salary . 
hey guys . 
what ' cha talking about ? [ camera pans to each face in the break room ] okay , i know what ' s going on . you ' re talking about jim and pam , if they ' re having sex , what it looks like , i know , i think - - - 
hey , hey , hey . 
monkey problem ? no , i ' m not having monkey problems . why would i have monkey problems ? 
oh , i hate monkeys . 
i don ' t have a second job . maybe i ' m having an affair with suzanne summers . 
i don ' t talk to my girlfriend about money . it is rude , and unsexual . 
i totally agree with you . but i don ' t have money problems , i don ' t . alright , you know what ? watch this , if i had money problems , would i do this ? [ michael holds up a bill , crumples it up , puts it back in his pocket ] 
yeah , but i destroyed it , it ' s not even useable anymore . 
no you didn ' t . 
how would that help creed ? in monopoly when you go bankrupt , you lose . 
that is a good point . 
like the witness protection program . 
i ' ve always wanted to be in the witness protection program . fresh start , no debts , no baggage . i ' ve already got my name picked out , lord rupert everton . i ' m a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs . that ' s the life . 
i . . . declare . . . bankruptcy ! 
i didn ' t say it , i declared it . 
yeah , tell me about it . 
you know , jan has my credit cards , and she ' s using them as if i ' m made of money , she thinks i ' m a human atm machine . 
oh , that ' s the muppet show , on dvd , classic . 
that is by far the best way to strengthen your core . this machine , you sit on a stabilizer ball , you put your feet into the power stir - ups , you reach up and you grab onto the super rod , and you twist , and you twist , and you twist . it strengthens your entire core . your back core , your arm core , the marine core actually uses it . i think that ' s how they got a core . 
mm - hm . that is so cool how you have my name at the top . 
right . 
how do they do this so fast ? is this power - point ? 
no , no , we are going to leave jan out of this . 
we will find another way , we ' ll ask power - point . 
you ' re a presentation tool if you think i ' m gonna tell jan about this . 
no you ' re not ! ok , just . . . you ' re not a tool . look , we ' ll tell her that it ' s bad , but it could ' ve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work i was able to cut it in half . 
she poses . 
um , that ' s , how did you get that from what oscar ' s saying ? 
what am i doing ? i am blowing dodge . i ' m getting out of town . whatever you call it , i am running away from my responsibilities . and it feels good . 
 [ singing ] runaway train , never come back . runaway and i ' m never coming back . 
hey jan . 
not much , what ' s up with you ? 
i ' m out of answers jan . 
i told you , no more answers . this is who i am now . a guy on a train with no answers . i hope that can be enough for you . 
i don ' t know that . 
i ' ll stay off the grid . 
yeah it is , it is . i really messed up . 
that ' s really nice of you to say . 
i think the engineer left . 
don ' t sell your implants please . 
that ' s nice though . 
it looks cute though . 
i used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time . they would say things like " don ' t pay for six months " or " you can transfer your account from another card " . . . 
do you think i ' ll get any new ones ? i could . . . [ pause , eventually looks up at dwight ] 
what do you mean , " what " ? 
were you listening to what i was saying ? 
what is the matter with you ? 
yeah . 
yeah . 
all right , well , go find some . get outa here , please . [ dwight sighs and leaves ] 
yeah . what ? 
um , my cds . 
i do . 
my cds are in a portfolio , a rather large portfolio , um , called case logic 
and , um the case logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car . there is another smaller case logic portfolio clipped to my visor [ oscar vigorously shakes his head ] what ? 
i ' ve been putting money into cds for years . i bought music that i didn ' t even like . no . [ shakes head ] 
i can ' t . 
i can ' t go back to that . 
i don ' t know if i can do that . i can ' t see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole . 
we will ? i can ' t . i don ' t have an idea in my head . 
i have . . . 
okay . what ? um . . . 
tell me . 
well , please ? i won ' t tell anybody . 
yeah , i will . 
yeah ! everything ! oh it ' s all good , it ' s all good . phyllis ! 
dancing babies ! i love it ! i love it ! 
we are making a commercial for dunder mifflin today . our first ad ever . corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about dunder mifflin infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so . . . it ' s uh , not too shabby . 
okay , it ' s football cream . it ' s football cream . alright ! so , anybody else ? 
look at that . even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity . very good , very good . 
hello hello ! 
michael scott . 
regional manager . 
excited to talk ideas . 
you know , i want this to be cutting edge . i want it to be fast , quick cuts , you know , youthful , sort of a mtv on crack kind of thing . 
all right , good , well this is what we have to work with . 
i would like you to meet andrew bernard . the ' nard dog . who let the ' nard dog out ? 
he gives the best back rubs in the office . 
now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe . 
stanley is hilarious . phyllis is like our mrs . butterworth . kind of a less urban aunt jemima . 
these are our accountants . and as you can see they are very different sizes . what you might want to do is kind of a papa bear , mama bear , baby bear thing . that might be kind of fun . 
who else ? 
 [ reading off piece of paper ] little girl in a field holding a flower , we zoom back to find that she ' s in the desert and the field is an oasis . zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world ' s largest resort hotel . zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world ' s largest prison . but we zoom back further - - - 
actually i don ' t get paid by the hour anymore , but thank you , i get paid by the year , so . . . 
yeah , i know . 
mmm . okay . [ commercial plays on laptop , peppy music in background ] 
that ' s what nassau came up with ? that sucks ! [ chuckles ] whoa . 
well we can do better than that . 
the waving ? 
 [ on speakerphone , eddie murphy voice ] shrek ! shrek , i ' m a donkey ! i ' m a donkey , shrek ! [ laughing ] i ' m just kidding . it ' s me . hello ry . 
okay , calm down . i have a small problem . 
yeah , well when i call about big problems you don ' t like that either , so make up you mind , kiddo . here is the deal , the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box , and sort of ignoring my ideas . 
i ' m creative , ryan . 
well actually i can ' t cook , and i am starting a restaurant . mike ' s cereal shack . i ' m thinking we ' ll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store . 
yeah ! 
are you ? i don ' t think you ' re doing such a good job here , suppressing ideas and creativity . 
all right , let me ask you this , tell me if you think this is creative . when i was five , i imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn . and this is before i had even heard of one , or seen one . i just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows , and had a huge spike in its head . and i was five , five years old . couldn ' t even talk yet . 
hey guys , um , you know what , we cannot shoot this ad today . 
how about never hundred hours , sir . 
hey thanks . thank you . 
yeah , i ' m glad you called . ryan is being a little bitch again . 
what ' s up my brotha ? listen , david , i would like to do this ad in house . i want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office . and i will send it to you tomorrow morning , take a look at it , and if you do not think that it ' s ready to air , send the ad agency back down here , and we ' ll do it on my dime . 
i ' m willing to stake my entire reputation on it . 
okay . [ hangs up phone ] and thus , michael scott sealed his own destiny . in a good way . 
has anyone ever come up to you and said , " you ' re not creative " ? 
well they ' re wrong . you are creative . you are damn creative . each and every one of you . you are so much more creative than all of the other dry , boring morons that you work with . 
we have three scenes to film , big scenes . we have a song to write . so let ' s get cracking . kelly , i want you to do makeup . oscar , i would like you to do costume design , obviously . phyllis , i ' d like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area . 
okay , okay , phyllis this is what i want you to do . i want you to go down to the mall . i want you to get in line . i want you to get her to be in this commercial . this would be a huge coupe people . all right ? do not take no for an answer . 
line it up phyllis . 
time out , time out , time out , time out , time out . i thought . . . i was under the impression that this was going to be a rap . 
okay , darryl , wow , you need to learn a lot about your own culture . i ' ll make you a mix . 
stop . stop stop stop stop stop stop . this is not me . this is not my music . 
no , i hate it ! i hate it ! . . . i don ' t hate it , i just don ' t like it at all . and it ' s terrible . 
okay , you know what . hold on , hold on darryl . 
no . i said i hate the , the style . 
okay , wow . wow , this looks uh , terrible . 
andy , andy , this is a pivotal scene in the ad . and if we don ' t get this , if we don ' t nail it , we ' re going to lose the whole triumph of the moment . the triumph of the will . now , god , what ? what phyllis ? 
that ' a girl . 
did you , or did you not get sue grafton ? 
ugh , can somebody give her a tissue please ? [ kevin hands her piece of tape ] 
i ' m about to send the ad to corporate . . . and it is sent . they ' ll probably watch it right away . i know i would . okay . [ dials phone ] 
pam , please clear my phone lines . 
they could call at any second now . [ sighs ] oh god . . . i better call . 
 [ ten days later ] well , it ' s been tough . the uh , geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version . so welcome one and all to the world premiere of corporate crapfest ! 
no , it was stupid . people like waving , waving sells . it ' s not art . yet we made our ad , the real one was full of humor , and full of depth , and full heart and it was real . 
that was fun . next round of drinks is on me , people ! 
all right ! so , anybody else ? no bad ideas . everybody , let ' s keep ' em coming . . . oh , god . okay , toby ? 
there are no bad ideas but for an idea , that was really , really bad . 
and that is probably why most ads suck . [ points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room ] oh , that ' s them ! those are the ad guys right there . all right , my very fortunate and creative group , go back to your desks and i will let you know when it is time to film . [ everyone starts leaving the conference room ] [ loud whisper ] pam ! pam , come here for a second . did you get the memo about dressing your best ? 
about dressing your best today ? 
cool . cool , i just wanted to make sure you got it . 
okay , good . good . 
this is pam beesly , representing our girl next door . pretty but nothing special . you know , but she sort of keeps it real . what you might want to do , is if you could zoom in , like really quick zooms on her . might be good . [ walking away ] who else ? [ pointing ] oh , creed . . . is the old guy over there . don ' t look at him . you might want to use him to sort of get that orville redenbacher dynamic going . 
and if not we can just make him disappear . [ walks quickly over to jim ' s desk ] this is jim ! halpert . jim has a very expressive face , don ' t you jim ? he is like our mr . bean . 
so do , um , do sad , do the sad face . 
no , that ' s skeptical . do sad . 
that ' s , that ' s a pirate movie . [ jim stares at michael ] that ' s annoyed . well , he doesn ' t do very well under pressure . 
and anybody else , we can just hire an actor to replace . follow me ! let ' s get this movin ' . [ dwight goes back to his seat , embarrassed ] 
all right , let ' s start . 
you are my producer , you are a suit . i am the creative genius . you take care of all the boring stuff , and let my mind just run free . 
now , we have eighty - five dollars , and a sam goody gift certificate . . . 
 . . . and we need to be done by 9 a . m . tomorrow . 
we start on a single blank sheet of paper . 
and we widen to reveal ancient rome . 
okay , we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman ' s womb . 
bull [ censored ] man ! 
this is bull [ censored ] ! 
ahhhh ! [ sweeps toys off his desk ] 
if you don ' t let me pursue my artistic vision , i am going to walk ! 
no ! no ! jim , jim , don ' t , don ' t . . . 
no , i can do it . 
i can do it good . i can do it good . please , don ' t . please . [ kneels in front of desk ] please give me it . 
 [ taps on desk and starts to leave his office ] do you want this open or closed ? 
hey , everybody , i just got off the phone with david wallace , and he has given us the go - ahead to make the first ever dunder mifflin television commercial . huh ? 
i can ' t hear you ! [ less applause ] heard you a little bit less that time . must be . . . 
okay , okay . who could do music ? 
actually , i ' m a little concerned about having a black person do the music , because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a . . . celestine prophesy , and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano . 
this is perfect . 
this is a dummy , a la ferris bueller ' s day off . we have tied a string to the wrist , which goes to the door . when somebody opens the door , the hand goes down , hits the remote , turns on the tape recorder , which is me snoring . now nobody knows whether i am here , or whether i am gone . 
but , you will not tell anyone . 
well , sometimes . most of the time i will be with ryan , or darryl . [ knock on the door ] yes ? oh good , good stanley ! first victim , this is what i want you to do . go out , come back in . we ' re going to hide . i want you to tell me if this looks like me , okay ? 
just go out , and come back in . 
what ? 
hey everyone , can i have your attention please ? i just thought you all should know that stanley hudson is planning on leaving us , because our old friend karen from utica is going to give him more money to work there . 
no , no , no , no , no - no , no no . you completely misinterpreted my tone , this is a horrible thing . clearly , karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her . 
okay , smarty pants , then why ? why is she trying to take stanley from us ? 
that could not possibly be it . 
you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office . stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary . the bluesy wisdom , the sassy remarks , the crossword puzzles , the smile , those big watery red eyes . i don ' t know how george bush did it when colin powell left , and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley , they have another thing coming . 
how can i get you to stay ? 
yeah we all want money . but there is none in the budget , so . . . tell me why you ' re really leaving . 
mo money mo problems , stanley . you of all people should know that . let me ask you this , if i were - 
pssh , kay . 
fillipellers , how ' s it hanging ? 
to the left ? 
to the right ? 
okay , enough small talk , go ahead . 
yes , listen , um . . . you cannot tear stanley from his family like this . 
no , his work family . look , this is very hard for me , but i ' m going to give you my best man . you may have toby . 
you can train him . he ' s very very smart , and funny , and charming . . . you know , i can ' t do it , toby is the worst . that - that was a bluff , um . . . listen , if you are going to poach one of my guys , i ' m going to poach one of yours . 
okay , good - bye . wait ! wait ! karen , could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please ? your best one ? [ karen hangs up ] 
hi ben , michael scott . 
i ' m going to cut right to the chase here . do you like magic ? because i ' m a genie in a bottle , and i ' m going to grant you three wishes . to move to scranton , to have a great job , and to be my best friend . 
 [ to pam ] get out . [ to ben ] uh , yeah . i also saved her life , but i guess that ' s not as grabby . 
no , i fired them , and your next . . . . so what do you say ? 
what is that guy talking about ? scranton is not lame . scranton is the cool , fun branch . we ' re like animal house . 
jim , we ' re getting crapped on . word is that our branch sucks , and we have to do something about it . 
what are we going to do ? we are going to make a monster sale , that ' s what we ' re going to do . corcroan dropped staples . 
yes they did , oh yes they did , and we are going to murder it . you , me , dwight are going to jump into my pt cruiser , and we ' re going to crush this sale . we ' re going to prove , what the hell is that music ? 
that ' s the problem , that ' s the problem . we need rock n ' roll pam , rock n ' roll . alright ? [ sees toby in a bow - tie holding a plate full of tea cups ] oh . . . my . . . god , that ' s why people are leaving . i - i have no words . 
what ? what ? we did ? 
look at his face ! look at his face ! 
what are we doing , dwight , what we are doing ? 
we are going on a panty raid to utica , is what we ' re doing . 
uh - huh . 
yes you are . oh , buckle up jim . 
we are going to make karen wish that she had never been dumped by you . 
in your face 
are you calling karen ? 
yep , get it . 
it had to be done , it had to be done . 
hey dwight , he found it . 
alright , you ' re going to miss the best prank ever . 
do you really wanna know ? 
follow me , come here . here ' s what we brought , we brought uniforms from the warehouse . i brought silly string , dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs . 
no , no , not real bombs . 
uh , maybe , maybe , i don ' t know . 
it could be badass . yeah , it will . 
teach her to offer stanley more money . 
so , why did you and karen break up ? was it the sex ? 
i can ' t imagine the sex being bad , i mean her body is . . . 
 . . . awesome . 
okay , i will start . um , " a . " [ singing ] " a " my name is alan , and my wife ' s name is alice , we live in alaska , and we sell . . . damn it ! what do we sell ? um . . . 
i ' m trying to think of what we could sell . 
ah , la , la , la . what is that ? that sound . . . the air - conditioning leaking or something ? 
what is that ? dwight , are you peeing ? 
come on man , that is disgusting dwight ! 
i ' ll kill you man ! 
that is just so disgusting ! 
afro wig , do you want the afro wig ? 
yeah , dwight , here ' s how it ' s going to go down . you and i - 
you and i are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers . and then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place . 
 [ from the walkie - talkie ] we are in a stairwell . 
there ' s a guy , there ' s a guy . 
oh my god , oh my god , that was very close . 
we found something far better , their crown jewel . their industrial copier . 
it ' s enormous , but it ' s got wheels . we ' re wheeling it down the hall , into the stairwell . get the car ready , keep the engine running . 
aha ! [ crashing ] 
we ' re wedged between the copier and the railing . ah ! ow ! ow , my leg ! jim leave us . 
save yourself ! 
dwight , you gotta move ! 
dwight , could you move over a little bit . 
take her to a motel , make love to her jim . 
just say you wanna get back together . 
it doesn ' t have to mean anything . just , do it for stanley . come on jim , just climb on top of her and think about stanley . ah , jim , if this is it for me , promise me something , host the dundies . 
 [ whispers ] dwight . granted , maybe this was not the best idea , but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them . and if you so much as harm a hair on stanley ' s head , we will burn utica to the ground . [ they get up to leave ] 
we tried and we failed . stanley , you may go . here is a box , for your things , but i doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place . fly away sweet little bird , fly away and be free . pam , i ' m gonna need some help writing a want ad . 
um , wanted : middle aged black man with sass . big butt , bigger heart . [ knock on the door ] i can ' t do this . 
of course . 
really ? 
utica is snoozeville , um , albany are the prepsters , nashua , no parking , um , akron is haunted , camden . . . is in a basement , yonkers has the two hot girls , and here in scranton , we are the cool guys . 
woo ! shotgun ! 
yes , i am , but i want shotgun for you . 
no , dwight ! dwight , jim is sitting next to me . you ' re gonna sit in the back left where i don ' t have to see your ugly moongob . 
i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry . dwight , you ' re handsome . you ' re a very handsome man , get in the car . 
dwight ! stop it ! [ moans ] can you help me please , i ' m being crushed . 
would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room ? like i begged you to ? pam would have understood . heck , pam would have done it . 
you embarrassed us . 
morning . 
 [ from outside ] hey , nobody cares . nobody cares . i need that room at some point , so just , wrap it up . 
hypothetically , if i were to ask you to go camping , and you know what hypothetical means ? [ jim makes a face ] not real . 
so if i were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me , would you go ? 
really ? 
oh , you wanna go today ? 
how often can you actually donate blood ? 
your body only has a certain amount . 
yeah , just this whole toby , camping thing , uh , seems a little lame . 
a bunch of guys , in a tent ? making s ' mores ? [ makes a noise and gestures with his hands ] 
hello , i ' m broken mountain . you know , here ' s the thing . that ' s not how you go camping . i think you go camping by yourself - - - 
in the wilderness . it ' s not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents . it ' s one guy , or two guys , if your plans change . 
i wanna do it myself . you know , i want to go and , and find out something about myself , i wanna get outta here . all the cliques , and the office politics . fluorescent lights . asbestos . 
i ' m sick of it jim . i ' m sick of this place . 
when jan and i had satellite , we used to watch a reality show called " survivorman . " and , it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die , try not to get eaten by an animal , or be overexposed . 
ok , i will only need two things . roll of duct tape and a knife . 
ok . thirty minutes or less , please come back . save the receipts . [ dwight comes back with set of knives ] hey , what . . . 
hey , hey hey ! dwight . [ dwight rolls out an assortment knives ] . dwight . 
dwight and i are going out . he will return later , but i will not . i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow , and perhaps the next day . 
no . 
dwight will be driving me deep into the pennsylvania wilderness . 
where he will then leave me to either die or to survive . the choice is yours . 
yes , and i am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days . do not try to follow me . 
this is a very personal , private experience in the wild , that i wish to share it with me , myself and i . 
when i return , i hope to be a completely changed human being . 
this is what a true survivor man does . you simulate a disaster , like a plane wreck . you could only wear the clothes that you have on , and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets . now , in this case , this disaster is a serial killer . creepy guy who ' s abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead . 
well , yes i would . and i would survive . 
well . . . 
you . . . 
you . . . you are as creepy as a real serial killer . for real . [ blindfolds eyes with tie ] ok . 
i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings . now this way , i can ' t retrace my steps . i don ' t know what streets we ' ve been - - - [ dwight whacks michael with his shoe ] ow ! what are you doing ? 
no ! gosh ! dwight . [ dwight tries to hit michael with his shoe again ] stop it , stop it ! stop it . 
just , please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life ? 
 [ flashback to stanley ' s birthday ] look at those wrinkles . blacks do crack ! not crack the drug . 
 [ flashback to kelly ' s birthday , hiding in the elevator ] happy birthday ! 
 [ flashback to oscar ' s birthday , hiding in the break room ] happy birthday ! 
 [ flashback to phyllis ' birthday , sneaking up on phyllis ' car ] happy birthday ! 
dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest . just the two of us from this point out . 
what are you doing ? stop . dwight , dwight . just - - 
stop . 
alright , good . thank you , dwight . 
alright , very good . ahh , ok . [ dwight gives michael a hug ] 
thanks for the ride . ok . leave me be , dwight . [ dwight runs off ] 
 [ to own camcorder ] day one . i ' m in the interior of the vast pennsylvania wilderness . i ' ve brought with me only the bare essentials . a knife , roll of duct tape , in case i need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel . it ' s hot today . the sun is in the two - thirds easterly quadrant , which would make it about [ looks at watch ] 2 o ' clock in the afternoon . it ' s really beating down on me now . i think that i want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources . [ cuts pants with knife ] ok . oh , there we go . watch that i don ' t hit my corroded artery here . . . 
there we go . [ standing with short sleeves and short pants ] much better . now everything i brought with me can be used . my sport coat here , can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ ties jacket around neck ] . 
i ' m going to wear what was once one of my pant legs . [ puts pant leg on head like a hat ] 
see , this is a beautiful piece of material [ rips other pant leg in half ] this could be used for all sorts of things . 
some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable . 
i am totally alone right now , with only my thoughts . i love it . i ' m loving it . i can literally say anything i want . no one is gonna here me . [ screams ] wish i could have gone with ryan on that cool retreat ! jan has plastic boobs ! i have hemorrhoids ! doesn ' t even matter . 
well it is a little chillier than i had thought , so i have fashioned my hat back into my pants . several hours in , time for me to find some nourishment . now , these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life . things like , uh , squirrels , nice juicy rabbit would be delicious . 
i have made this spear , with which i will impale my dinner . and it couldn ' t come a moment too soon because i have been without food for a good three hours or so . i ' m startin ' to feel it a little bit . ohh . . . it ' s creed ' s birthday . [ singing ] happy birthday to you . happy birthday to you . happy birthday to creed . happy birthday to you . happy birthday , buddy . 
well if you take a look at this , i tented my pants . i ' ve made myself a nice pants tent shelter . and this little guy [ pats a large tree trunk ] may be dunder mifflin paper some day . 
under this tree , i think i struck the mother load . those [ points camera to mushrooms ] are nature ' s best mushrooms . wild , and i have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well . [ puts them in mouth ] 
yeah ! [ everybody clapping ] alright , skip around the room . skip around the room . we want - - ok , alright . yeah , don ' t do that . you ' re gonna break something . 
man became civilized for a reason . he decided that he liked to have warmth , and clothing , and television , and hamburgers , and to walk upright , and to have a soft futon at the end of the day . he didn ' t want to have to struggle to survive . i don ' t need the woods . i have a nice wood desk . i don ' t need fresh air , because i have the freshest air around , a . c . and i don ' t need wide open spaces . check it out . [ shows off computer screen scenery ] i can also make it the sky . 
hey , buddy . 
what up ? 
you are relieved . 
so what did i miss ? 
oh . 
yeah , okay , i did that . rookie mistake . 
uh huh . yeah , just wait . ten years , you ' ll figure it out . 
that ' s what i said . that ' s what she said . 
i never know . i just say it . i say stuff like that , you know , to lighten the tension . when things sort of get hard . 
hey ! nice . really good . bravo , my young ward . 
come in ! 
pam , are you my friend ? 
we have been friends forever , right ? 
hypothetically . . . would you go camping with me , if i were to ask you ? and bear in mind that i would never actually ask you to go camping . that jim is also a friend of mine , and i would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you . 
do you understand that jim is like a brother to me , and i would never do anything inappropriate ? 
so , as friends , would you go with me on a camping trip ? 
thank you for your honesty . 
split the difference . hey . . . mint chocolate chip , please ? is jim out there ? 
can you send dwight in here ? 
mmhmm . i had something very personal i would like to discuss . [ dwight closes door , takes off glasses , kneels in front of michael ' s desk ] would you go find jim , and send him in here , please ? 
okay . 
all right , dexter , just give me the knife . 
no , just get me a case . [ dwight looks at the camera , lifts his leg onto the desk , removes the sheath from his ankle , and gives it to michael ] all right . 
mmmmm . all i need . . . 
no , dwight ! 
i ' m telling you , all i will need are my instincts and my will to survive . 
 [ holding up knife ] what is this called again ? 
i ' ll call back . 
 [ pam walks in and shows michael a note that says " good morning " ] yeah , um , tell him i ' ll call him back . 
you can ' t always work 200 days though . 
 [ pam walks in and shows michael a note that has a smiley face ] oh , no , no , no , i don ' t have time for this . tell him i ' m in a meeting . [ jan looks impressed ] 
yep . 
oh . ah , this is a very important client . but , i have the most important client sitting right in front of me , my boss , so i will call him later . 
n - no , money isn ' t everything ryan . and you ' re my friend , and i don ' t want to be rude . 
i refuse . my house , my rules , i insist . 
uh , okay , all right . pam , would you put the call through ? [ pam pushes a button the phone ] hi buddy . 
yeah , i hate that . 
so , here ' s the deal . um , i am on my way to new york to be deposed as part of jan ' s wrongful termination law suit . the company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs . 
yes , yes . pat - tern . patt - ern . my friend pat took a turn . that ' s how i remember that . could we pull over and put down the top ? i ' m feeling a little queasy . 
well - 
disray . my friend disray got news specs . disray spect . my friend inappro drives a prius with his behind neighbor . 
yep . tell them how much you ' re gonna get if you win . 
million dollars ! 
four million dollars ! man that is a lot of guacamole . a lot of the green . lot of green . that is why i have memorized jan ' s answers , and i have also thrown in some errs , and ahhs , to make it seem like it ' s not memorized . 
perfect crime . 
could we please pull over and pull down the top , i do not feel good . 
i ' m getting car sick ! ugh , i ' m gonna puke . i think i ' m gonna throw up . 
hey , schneider , real quick . what do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff ? 
yeah , a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus . [ to jan ] where did you find this guy ? hey , there he is . 
hey hey . 
i would love that . 
abso - fruitley . yeah . i ' ll - i ' ll do anything for the company .

hi . [ michael sees toby ] no , no , absolutely not . what is he doing here ? 
are you renewing your divorce vows , before my deposition ? 
never . i want him gone . i don ' t talk until he leaves . 
okay . all right . 
yessh . 
well , it was not just termination . it was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior . 
i haven ' t actually seen it . but i have seen the firm , and i am planning on renting the pelican brief 
six years and two months . 
that ' s what she said . 
that ' s what she said . 
uh , wh - why would she say that ? 
come again ? that ' s what she said ? i don ' t know what you ' re talking about . 
well , delivery is all wrong . she ' s butchering it . 
she thought it had to do with the twins . that ' s what i call them . 
um , to be delicate , they hang off milady ' s chest . they . . . make milk . 
yes . 
yes , and frankly , the timing was nothing short of predominant . 
well , if it did , then the company is breaking its own rules . 
because before we started dating , we disclosed our relationship to hr . and i have the proof right here . [ makes a gasping sound ] 
i will allow it . 
uh . . . 
uh - huh . 
ugh . well , de - depends on how you define " begin " . i mean , if it was from the first time we shook hands , that ' s like six years ago . if it ' s from the first time we kissed , that ' s like two years ago . 
if it was the first time we kissed sober , it was like four months after that . 
line . 
jan and i had an off again , on again relationship for two years . and i know this destroys her case , and i am sorry , but i throw myself at the mercy of the deposition . 
whoa whoa whoa whoa ! what are you doing with my diary ? 
irie . 
i don ' t think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary . 
 [ looking for a place to sit , goes to toby ' s table ] can i sit here ? 
how can you give up my diary like that ? 
how ' d you even find it ? 
i don ' t like lump . i ' m really upset about this . 
fine . i love you . 
not a woman , just a cool , great looking , best friend . 
alright , alright . this is the way i see it . yes , i had sex with jan , and yes , i did consider jan to be my girlfriend . however , jan clearly didn ' t consider me to be her boyfriend . so her actions are completely rightful . 
thank you very much . you didn ' t have to say that . 
that was before our relationship . she was going through a divorce , and she was drinking a lot . . . [ jan glares at michael ] . . . of water . 
march 17th . 
yes . 
 [ reading the performance review ] " i am out of carrots . i am out of sticks . mr . scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee , and a poor branch manager . i recommend he be removed from that position and re - assigned to sales where he belongs . " 
 [ stares at diane , eyes tearing up ] 
how can you do that to me ? 
dunder mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect , with loyalty . they were going to give me your job and i should have taken it . 
see ? i was his number 1 contender . i was being groomed . 
 . . . absolutely not . 
oh , hey no biggie . just . . . 
 [ nods and shakes hands with david wallace ] hey , david ? 
i think you ' re a nice guy too . 
why did i do it ? i don ' t know . jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary . but she already brought the diary with her to new york , so . . . you expect to get screwed by your company , but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend . 
 [ driving with jan in the car ] what do you want to do for dinner ? 
sure trying to save some money . . . get something cheap . 
do you fast food ? 
i have some , uh , experience . i , um , once had to testify in a traffic accident case . 
yes . my testimony was actually very important , um , because the accident was my fault . [ to toby ] tell meredith i said it another time [ toby nods ] . 
before we continue , i would like to make an opening statement . 
 [ clears throat and stands ] ladies and gentlemen of . . . the . . . table . i would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today , but frankly , at my age , it ' s a joy to be anywhere [ no one laughs ] . i ' m only forty - four , so i ' m not old , and i guess that doesn ' t really play . but the point is , i have a sense of humor . and i implore you all to have a sense of humor as well . jan , david , my wonderful girlfriend [ indicates jan , then turns to david wallace ] , my gorgeous company . . . why don ' t we all just take a big deep breath . . . and just relax [ breathes in deeply , no one responds ] . good . that feels good [ sits ] . all right . everybody feel better ? 
na , na - oh , naa - es . 
ye - ohh . ye - no . 
very nice ! [ borat voice ] 
high five ! [ borat voice ] 
 [ shakes head ] can ' t stop . 
forgot normal talk . 
nobody likes to work late , least of all me . [ to jim ] do you have plans tonight ? 
yes i remember . mmm , this is b . s . this is b . s . why are we here ? i am going to call corporate . enough is enough , i ' m - god , i ' m so mad ! [ on phone ] this is michael scott , scranton , well we don ' t want to work . no we don ' t ! it ' s not fair to these people . these people are my friends and i care about them ! we ' re not going to do it ! [ hangs up ] everybody i just got off the horn with corporate and basically i told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment . go enjoy your friday . 
all right , happy friday . [ to jim ] well i think we dodged a bullet there . 
i think we should celebrate . how about you , pam , mi casa , a little dinner , dancing , drinks ? 
you said you didn ' t have plans . that ' s what you said . 
dwight , it ' s couples only . and besides , i only have six wine glasses , so it will be me and jan , and pam and jim , and angela and andy . 
hello . 
come on in . good to see you . 
yes i would . so , what have you been doing ? 
yeah . 
well we have been doing pretty much the same thing . 
except driving . 
well have a seat , or come on in , or , i don ' t know , make yourself to home . this is our casa . 
okay . 
totally your call babe . 
oh , just redoing the sliding glass door . 
well , thats . . . 
yep , never been used . 
no . 
this is it , check that out , can you smell that ? [ the room is filled with candles that say " serenity by jan " ] 
as you can smell there ' s a lot of different odors going on in here . 
bond . 
james bond fire . i am bond fire , james bond fire . michael scarn . [ clicks tongue ] 
guess what , white and eggshell white are exactly the same color . 
well , i - 
thanks , that ' s my bed . jan has some space issues , so i curl up on that puppy . 
it ' s actually a lot bigger than it seems . look at this . [ lies down ] 
i finally broke down and bought myself a plasma tv . check it out . [ reveals a tiny tv ] i actually hung this on the wall myself . i want to show you something . a lot of people in the room , need more space ? [ moves tv back a couple inches ] voila , right in the wall . 
sometimes i will just stand here and watch television for hours . i love it , i love this tv . oh and i also built this table . 
no , i think that is either pine , or nordic cherry . 
if you ever need any help , i am just a phone call away . 
oh honey , i have the best trophy right here , aside from my dundies . 
i ' ll get it . 
okay . 
very nice . 
when in rome . 
whatever you say babe . 
all right . 
how ' bout a toast . shall i ? here ' s to good friends . 
kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth . 
yeah that sounds good . 
you know what , hunter was a terrible assistant , that is why ryan fired him . 
all right , [ rhythim clapping ] my my my my turn , my my my my turn , my my my my turn . 
what , no , i ' m just making people laugh . 
yes , i was watching jim ' s face . 
and he was laughing . 
look at him , he ' s laughing . 
well you don ' t need two of you to do that . 
that ' s true , that ' s a great point . come on down here . sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed , all right . 
all right here we go , this is going to be fun , ready . all right first name is tom - 
all right , okay , okay , you ' re getting inside my head . first name is blank and he goes on a cruise , he goes on a caribbean cruise . 
no , baah ! but he ' s married to her ! 
no ! it has to be a real person jim , come on . okay , no no , i ' m gonna pass , i ' m gonna pass . okay , rhymes with parnold schporzenegger . 
okay , he is the governor of california , he is the terminator . 
no ! 
god , does anybody read the paper ? ! 
you ' re welcome . 
i don ' t like that story babe . 
stop , stop it ! i mean , i like ice cream . okay ? sue me . oh , no , don ' t . i shouldn ' t say that jokingly because she will sue me . she loves to sue , loves lawsuits . you know honey , that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible . 
ha ha , you are ! she is ! she is the devil ! i ' m in hell ! aaahhh i ' m burning , help me ! 
 [ in the garage ] so i spend most of my time right here . have a hand [ the chairs are shaped like hands ] . so jim i noticed you checking out jan ' s candles . 
yeah , did you know that candles are the number one fastest - growing product in the scent aroma market ? $ 2 billion dollar a year industry . and for only $ 10 , 000 , you could become a co - owner of " serenity by jan " what do you think about that ? 
i ' m sorry . [ doorbell rings ] what now ? 
dwight is my friend . 
you said that i could not invite dwight because he was not part of a couple , and because we didn ' t have enough wine glasses . dwight brought glasses and a person . 
whatever i want ? it ' s never whatever i want . when i wanted to see stomp , and you wanted to see wicked , what did we see ? 
when i said that i wanted to have kids , and you said , you wanted me to have a vasectomy , what did i do ? and then when you said that you might want to have kids and i wasn ' t so sure , who had the vasectomy reversed ? and then when you said you defintely didn ' t want to have kids , who had it reversed back ? snip snap ! snip snap ! snip snap ! i did . you have no idea the physical toll , that three vasectomies have on a person . and i bought this condo to fill with children . 
do you mean it ? you want to have a kid ? [ jan walks away ] 
 [ leans across to pam whispering ] pam . . . i hope she didn ' t do anything to the food . 
i can ' t prove it but i think she might be trying to poison me . [ jan serves the food ] hey , looks great babe . 
you know i have soft teeth , how can you say that ? 
excuse me for a second . [ gets up from the table ] 
ok . . . alright . . . here we go . [ takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign ] there . [ plugs it in ] oooookay . 
everybody enjoying their meal ? 
yeah ? 
no . no . i ' m gonna leave it up . i think it ties the whole room together . 
 [ to the guests ] jan thinks hunter is very talented . you know what ? i don ' t think he ' s that good . 
bfd . i ' m a screenwriter . 
no all you do is you get me to try to work on my rich friends ! 
man ! i would love to burn your candles ! 
oh good . i ' ll be your first customer ! 
 [ yells ] that ' s what she said ! [ jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up michael ' s dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv ] that is a 200 dollar plasma screen tv you just killed ! good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits , babe ! [ jan goes upstairs crying . ] 
you know what guys , she ' ll be out of the bathroom soon . 
nope . nope . nothing disturbing here . just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party . 
oh . . . yes . there was some screaming but . . . um . . . my girlfriend . . . threw a dundie at my tv . plasma . 
would she get into trouble ? 
i will take the fall . i did it . 
jim ? pam ? 
no . 
nope . 
 [ holding his head out of dwight ' s car ] 
my ideals at a party ? easy . jim . pam . ryan . the mayor . barack obama . shiloh jolie - pitt . because at the end of the night , brad or angelina would have to come and pick him up and i would get to meet them . shia la beef because of disturbia . umm , all of the children of the world . val kilmer . but he probably wouldn ' t come , too famous . obviously george clooney . umm . . . and jan definitely , if there was room . 
yes , i did , for you , princess . even though i only went number one . [ quietly to jim ] i didn ' t really wash my hands . ohhh , what have we here ? this looks delicious . [ picks up amuse - bouche tray ] 
 [ touching and moving each amuse - bouche ] they need to be presented . . . royally . . . anyone ? 
good stuff . all right . let ' s get down to some wine drinking . 
it ' s been a rough couple of weeks . 
little trouble . yes . well , jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift . 
yes . 
so she ' s passed out , and some kids spray - paint a swear word on the neighbors ' dog . . . 
and the neighbors blamed jan . 
it ' s like , you know , the dog shouldn ' t have been outside in the first place . anyway , it ' s a tragedy , really , because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds . . . 
so . . . 
well . 
pam , when i first opened this catalog , i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair . 
 [ holding up the catalog ] have you ever seen this woman ? 
hmm . . . 
look at her smile . those eyes , look at her eyes . she ' s got - i don ' t know what it is actually , she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch . 
oh , yeah , maybe , but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women ? 
i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman . [ whispers ] jan . i think that fate put this catalog in my hands . 
what is it like being single ? i like it . i like starting each day with a sense of possibility . and i ' m optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results . 
ladies and gentleman , would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85 . [ phone rings ] 
i am ready to start dating again . getting back on the market . so , fyi , for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends , use the woman on page 85 as a template . that will be all . 
 [ to kevin ] listen man , i am completely over jan , so , would you set me up ? 
i thought that you were engaged ? 
whaaaat ? god , that ' s terrible man . eghh , she ' s crazy . umm , are you still on good terms with any of her friends ? 
oh . . . 
yeah . . . ugh . she ' s . . . [ gets up and leaves ] you don ' t deserve her . alright . 
 [ sitting on oscar ' s desk ] oh hello oscar mayer weiner lover . i bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you ' d never touch ' em , because of your condition . umm . . . 
what ? 
oh . 
hmm , i see , feisty . so she ' s not jolly or sassy ? not like a jolly , sassy opera singer ? 
oooo . catcher or in field ? 
is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer ? could we share a row boat ? could , could a row boat support her ? 
i think i ' m being very clear what i ' m asking . would an average size row boat support her without capsizing ? [ silence ] it bothers me that you ' re not answering the question . 
damn it , i knew it ! i knew it phyllis ! ok ! 
what is wrong with these people ? i would do anything for them and they ' re just hanging me out to dry . 
dating shouldn ' t be hard for somebody like me , but it is and you know why ? because nobody here is willing to help me . nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request , would it ? well , fine . here goes . 
well , now ok , i know that this is probably not appropriate , but i need help . because i want to play ball with my kids before i get too old . and before that happens i need to get laid . and before that happens i need to be in love . and i don ' t wanna hear " ahnnn . . . i can ' t help elhh la la . " no . no . i ' m a catch and i am not going to be the one who got away . so , this is what we ' re going to do . dwight is going to hand out index cards and i want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day . no , by the end of the hour or you are fired . 
hmm . . 
well , look , i am in an assigned parking place in front , so . . . alright , alright , alright , umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one . [ thinks ] ok , yes that would be bad . 
that would be bad . 
wish i could , but i can ' t . well can , but won ' t . should , maybe , but shorn ' t . 
what part of shorn ' t don ' t you understand , kevin ? look i could probably handle it , yes , but i think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves . 
oh you can ' t because i don ' t care . listen , [ kevin and andy high five as they leave michael ' s office ] don ' t forget to fill out those cards . my love cards . 
ok , wendy . hot and juicy red head . give this a try . [ michael dials phone number . phone rings . ] 
hello wendy , this is kevin ' s friend , michael . 
oh , i ' m sorry , could you put her on please ? 
 [ under breath ] damn it kevin . ok , umm , could i just have a frosty and a baked potato please ? 
well , i ' ll send somebody to come pick it up . just have it ready . 
well put it aside . [ hangs up the phone ] [ dwight enters ] umm . . . yeah . 
good . good because this batch was awful . umm . . . this one says chair model . . . 
that sounds good . [ both smile ] go get her . wa - wait , wait , wait , wait . first , go to wendy ' s , get my food . come back and then go . 
she ' s dead ? [ dwight makes knife slitting noise ] she ' s so young . 
oh , god . oh . . . 
try not to be so hurtful jim . 
please , not at a time like this . [ sighs ] 
oh really ? what ' s her name ? burger king ? 
i don ' t , i don ' t think i ' m ready . is she hot ? 
no question about it , i am ready to get hurt again . 
 [ while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush ] no , not the five families . 
 [ still brushing teeth ] sorry , i don ' t have time for this right now . i ' m trying to get a date with pam ' s hot friend . and she needs to meet me right now . 
 [ to cashier at coffee shop ] thank you very much . our suspect has straight brown hair . she is wearing blue jeans and a black top . so . . . behold our bachelorette [ cut to a blonde woman in a skirt ] . give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself . hello , my lady . [ woman walks right by and doesn ' t respond ] 
 [ turns around to see the woman from his description ] ugh . 
is who a michael what ? 
oh , that ' s not , yeah i ' m not . . . ok . . . 
so you get the rent checks every month and what happens next ? what . . . 
just making conversation . 
why is it so hard to meet people ? i . . . you know . . . it ' s uh . . . all i want is somebody nice and sweet and someone i can talk to and share an experience with , you know ? why is it so hard for people like us ? 
you wanna see what i walked out on ? this is gonna blow your mind . [ holds up cell phone with a picture of jan ] look at that . 
yeah . yeah , and you can ' t see her whole body . down here , she ' s got a boob job . just . . . she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and i don ' t know . 
oh , ok . well , umm . . . i enjoyed this conversation . it was very nice . it was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus . 
now you ruined it . [ gets up and leaves ] 
margaret the land lady ? really pam , is that what you think of me ? 
oh , ok , well i ' m looking for a passionate affair , not companionship . i ' m a man . . . of intensity , of , of cool and youth and , and passionately . god . . . [ walks away back to his office ] 
i don ' t know man . i was with jan for so long . i was excited about meeting somebody new . put my heart out there . it ' s just . . . [ sighs ] 
you ' re right . what do you mean though ? 
hmm . 
 [ looking at the chair model ' s headstone ] how did she die ? 
god . 
she was so innocent . 
you know i used to think that i had this perfect person out there waiting for me , but knowing that , that ' s just silly because she ' s dead . what do you do ? 
oh , you move on . 
 [ singing ] bye , bye , ms . chair model lady . i dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice . we had lots of kids . . . drinking whiskey and rye , oh why ' d you have to go off and die ? why ' d you have to go off [ with dwight ] and die ? 
return . 
this ' ll be [ with dwight ] the day that i died . 
it is moving day . i have spent the last month here at dwight ' s lovely farm , taking a little bit of a vacation , clearing my head after jan and i , um [ dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise ] ssp . . . no , i did not kill her . we were just at different places in our lives . no , i thought i ' d be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo . she has since moved on ; she is staying with her sister in scottsdale . fresh outlook , and it ' s all good . 
oh . what is this ? 
you were charging me ? i ' m your friend . 
there was no other guest the entire time i was here . 
okay . all right , dwight . take my money . go ahead . keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction . the late nights , the talks , the slumber parties , the crying jags , that was all business , that had nothing to do with friendship , and being friends . just ring me up . go ahead [ dwight tears up bill ] . 
thank you , dwight . 
dwight , little help with the bags , please . 
so , what about you , angela ? do you have any single friends ? 
a cute little religious type , someone who wears a uniform , or . . . 
no , no , obviously older . 
love . marriage . baby carriage . those have been my goals ever since i heard that song . jan and i had love . we did not have marriage . we did have a baby carriage , which i got her for bringing groceries home , after she got a dui . 
 [ sitting at her desk ] hey , kelly . 
nothing . just hangin ' . chillin ' . no agenda . would you consider hookin ' me up with one of your friends ? 
yeah ? 
that ' s hilarious . what ' s her number ? 
mmm . . . nah , that ' s too young . 
oh . 
 [ ' rita klondike 507 ' is written on an index card ] all right , time ' s up ! pencils down . please pass your future mrs . michael scotts forward . 
pammy ? 
you don ' t have one single girlfriend ? 
i ' m not looking for a perfect 10 here , just somebody to hang out with . just fun , healthy young woman . 
a kindergarten teacher , who is great with kids , maybe an ex - model , and now she wants to do something with her brain ? 
how ' bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side ? 
you know , just a fun , guh , look , there , here , it doesn ' t have to be a model . i ' m not , don ' t rule out model , but just in terms of models , there are like twenty different categories . there ' s face models , hand models , body models [ jim raises hand ] - yes . 
really ? 
no , i am , it ' s all about the personality , jim . 
send me a picture . 
so far , these are my leads . a blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher . it ' s a start . 
i got gum in my hair . 
this just stinks . don ' t touch it , please don ' t touch it . 
ok , let me be . 
i was walking in and i noticed something shinny under stanley ' s car and i got under to see what it was and i messed up my hair , all for a stupid piece of tinfoil . 
kill me . . . right now . 
i don ' t feel like peanut butter . get me an ice cream sandwich . 
hey , hey , hey . this is my hair we ' re talking about . 
smells good . 
oh don ' t . that ' s disgusting . 
well just don ' t leave it on too long . keep massaging please . ah yeah , that ' s nice . 
 [ sighs ] 
i will be honest ; the dating has not been going well . look , men are visual creatures . we crave beauty , like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists , or an arty photograph of cindy crawford nude . . . that , but the women i ' m getting fixed up with are , egh ! not that they aren ' t nice , or that have great personalities , they just . . . they just lack a certain . . . crawfordness . 
ladies and gentlemen , may i have your attention please . i know that a lot of you are very angry with ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow , however , i swear to god , if any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or . . . 
yeah . 
 [ slow clapping ] ryan has done a very good job , and i am not applauding sarcastically . think about it , a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested , or losing our identity , having it stolen . but now , at a time tdb , all of the problems will be in the past . ya done good kid , ya done good . 
well it has been nice seeing you again my friend . 
oh ryan , i need a girlfriend so bad . [ hugs ryan ] 
argh . alright . do you know any girls in new york you might want to hook me up with ? some that might be interested in a guy like me . 
na ? 
well you tried . 
yeah . 
they sound great . 
would you have sex with meredith ? 
do you think she ' d keep it quiet ? 
jim , it ' s not the horniness , ok it ' s the loneliness that . . . 
let ' s go to new york . we ' ll go clubbing with ryan . 
yes you can , you ' re single , i ' m single . it ' ll be awesome . 
who you dating ?

i am going to go get laid . goodbye .

ryan ' s assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening . it is called prerogative . 
place is packed . 
packed with beautiful babies . swingers . classic . john favreau , tall guy from dodgeball .

hey , nice to meet you . 
oh ok , all i know is i would like some chicken fingers and a midori sour . 
oh ok , then just bring me two cups , one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries . 
i umm , thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point . i was thinking about getting " back to the future . " " back " because it ' s on my back and " future " because i ' m the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future . i just think a tattoo should mean something , you know ? and it ' s my second favorite movie . 
back to the future ? [ she shakes head ] oh , wow . well you should take a , a film education course . 
forty . . . i ' m in my forties . 
nuhh . . . 
oh , ok . 
you are welcome . 
this place is like sexy pre - school . 
i would love a place where we could meet older girls . 
ahh , wow . that ' s dangerous . 
you ' re kidding . 
i ' ve never met anyone who does that . you wash dogs ? very cool . 
i am a bank teller . 
ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance . 
i think so . 
yeah , i have fun . 
all right . 
very perfect . [ girl walks away , michael laughs ] oh my [ notices dwight making out with tall girl # 1 ] this needs to be shared . [ takes a picture with his camera phone ] [ cut to the office - all office co - workers cell phones go off . they notice the picture michael has sent and all groan ] 
she washes dogs . 
i know . i don ' t wanna get ahead of myself , but i think i want her to meet my mom .

hmm . . . 
 [ on phonne ] i am . i am getting out there . well , no i ' ve asked a lot of girls to dance mom . they ' re just , it ' s not . . . [ ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over ] yes , i shaved above my neck . oh my god , mom , i gotta go . one of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls . 
 [ michael and troy dragging ryan out of the club ] those girls really wailed on you bad .

 [ muffled ] that ' s what she said . 
today is a very special day for me . and it ' s really not about me , it ' s about my grandkids , it ' s about my great grandkids . . . i can come back here when i ' m 100 , and i can find that piece of cement and say , " that ' s me . look kids , your daddy left that face hole . . . " i dunno , it ' s a good feeling . 
all right , everybody . . . oh my god , pam , those make you look so ugly . um , pam , in order to get hotter , you take the glasses off . you ' re moving in the wrong direction . . . 
ub , dub dah , don ' t need , i can ' t even hear you . it ' s just noise coming out of an ugly scientist . um , everybody , we ' re going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room . 
ener - gize . . . 
everybody , so how are we going to energize our office ? i mean , i haven ' t done anything since christmas . pam , clearly , has just given up trying . so what we need to do is we get things going , we need to get percolating a little bit . anybody have any ideas of what we could do . any suggestions ? yes , andy ? 
zing and pep , see that ' s those are the kind of words we ' re looking for . yes , jim ? 
now we ' re cooking . i like this . maybe a whole theme , like a rap . a rap rhyme . . . 
an urban , yeah , stanley ? you wanna help us out with that ? . . . stanley , earth to stanley . . . 
yes you . come on , stanley , put your little game down and join the group . 
stanley , we ' re havin a little . . . 
we ' re havin a little brainstorm session . . . 
 . . . good , this is good . i ' m going to grab a glass of water . 
ugh , what ? 
what are you blabbering about ? nothing happened . 
that ? in the conference room ? 
we were joshin around , the two of us , and he said " did i stutter , " and i said " wha - wha - wha - wha - what , dawg ? " it was joking , toby , alright ? 
well you don ' t get it , because stanley is a beautiful , sassy , powerful black man , and you ' re . . . you . if you had any friends , you would understand . friends joke with one another : " hey um , you ' re poor . " " well hey , you ' re mama ' s dead . " that ' s what friends do . it ' s . . . you ' re so white . 
mmhmm . 
okay , i will . . . i ' m not feeling very well right now though . my stomach hurts , so i may be going home early today , but . . . 
well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office , so it ' s probably psychological . 
i , uh , see that you . . . gave me that form that i asked you to give me , stanley the manly , so thank you for that . i guess we are back to normal . 
well , you know , uh , the thing that you said earlier , that you didn ' t mean , um , and that i forgive you for . the whole thing ' s silly , isn ' t it ? friends don ' t need to apologize to friends as far as i ' m concerned , so we are cool . 
uh huh . . . 
great 
what ' s the pink ? 
ok . . . is there anybody up here , anybody at all , that can deal with this ? 
other than me . 
i never said you could do that . 
i . . . 
okay , i will think about it . 
no . 
hey . 
darryl , [ clears throat ] have you ever been in a gang ? 
it ' s an advice question , and if you don ' t wanna talk about it , i completely understand . it ' s , um . . . 
i know , it ' s very , very personal . . . 
i knew it . okay , who we talking about here ? crips ? bloods ? 
god . 
okay . 
okay , so dig this : you ' re on the street , and one of your gang disses you . 
yeah , right , so what do you do to get them to make it right ? 
what is that ? 
really ? 
i would ' ve never thought that gangs would be tickling each other . 
okay , everybody , shh ! so , earlier today , stanley sassed me , and toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him . they did not work , obviously , because they were stupid , so i am now going to fake fire him . 
it ' s like a mock execution . 
yes it is a good idea . it ' s the only possible solution i have left . 
no , okay . . . i ' ve had enough of you . 
because i want you to behave as if i ' m actually firing him , oscar , okay ? 
i ' m not firing him . i ' m not , i need you to act like i am firing him . just , what i ' m going to do , is i ' m going to pretend that i am firing him , and i need you to act like i am firing him . do you get that ? do you get it ? i ' m teaching him a lesson . he needs to learn humility , alright ? that ' s all i ' m , okay , here he comes . let ' s just . . . play act . [ stanley enters the room ] stanley , may i talk to you for a second ? 
stanley hudson , you are fired . 
i am serious , we are all serious . you are fired like a heart attack . 
hmm . 
alright alright , okay , you know what ? now you know how i feel . this was a fake firing . lesson learned . good work , everybody . very nice . 
that ' s it . and uh . . . do you have anything to say to me ? 
okay . . . 
yes . 
that ' s not - 
all right , all right . . . 
okay . 
hey , stop it ! okay , everybody out . 
everybody , except stanley . 
 [ starts to cry ] i don ' t understand why you keep picking on me . 
you just , do , and i don ' t know why , so . . . please help me understand . 
well stanley , maybe you ' re feeling that you don ' t respect me because you don ' t know me very well . 
all right , you don ' t respect me . i accept that . but listen to me , you can ' t talk to me that way in this office , you just can ' t . i am your boss . can ' t allow it . 
i am good person , and sometimes , good people don ' t get no respect . rodney dangerfield . [ as rodney dangerfield ] hey , i don ' t get no respect . no respect at all . when i was in the sandbox as a kid , i got not respect . my wife likes to talk after sex , so she called me from a hotel room , and said , " i don ' t respect you ! " ahh , thoughtless . aw , you know what don ' t get no respect ? airplane food . why don ' t they just make the plane out of the airline food ? my wife don ' t get no respect , some - - take her , please , for example . [ as jeff foxworthy ] if you don ' t get no respect , you might be redneck . [ as borat ] respect is niiice . borat . [ as rodney dangerfield ] what ' s the deal with grapenuts ? no grapes , no nuts . i don ' t get no respect ! 
so i ' m thinking , as a reward for our loyal clients , that we contact their assistants , and we find out where they live . and then , we go to their houses , in the middle of the summer , and go caroling . it is a summer christmas sale - abration . and we call it , a summer sales - a - lot . feedback ? anybody ? stanley ? 
dammit , phyllis . alright , everybody out except phyllis . 
you know , i don ' t care what he did to me . he ' s mean to other people , that ' s what gets me . he ' s just . . . 
everybody . he just , he ' s always , he ' s always talking about people behind their backs to me . 
like that people are stupid , and that they ' re idiots , and that they ' re sluts . 
because he ' s mean . he ' s , he ' s like a really mean - spirited guy . he talks about how gay oscar is . . . 
and that angela ' s a midget , and that [ indicates jim ] your chin is too big . 
i know , i know . i think it ' s tiny . i think it ' s too small if anything . and that your glasses make you look ugly . 
well , he ' s just mean . 
it ' s complicated , pam . i mean , the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk . 
okay . 
i put stanley on a pedestal , for a long time . but sometimes he can just be a big , fat jerk . i . . . jerks don ' t deserve to be on pedestals . jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are . big marble . . . jerk stand . 
pam , stand up . 
pretty disgusting . 
hey . ready ? come on , show me excited ! 
yeah , i ' m pretty excited too . 
today i ' m heading over to the job fair at valley view high school , to find some new interns . want to get some fresh blood . um , euthanize this place . 
yup . 
why are you dressed like that ? 
like you ' re applying for a loan . 
okay , here ' s what we ' re going to do : i ' m going to instruct the kids about management and sales . oscar will be in charge of accounting . pam will be eye candy . no . . . uh , also , because that is your alma mater . darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse . we don ' t have to worry about internships with them , because they definitely ain ' t going to college . 
let ' s go ! 
 [ darryl approaches as students throw basketballs ] a little over the top , don ' t you think ? 
this is all we need . 
yes we will see oscar , we will see , because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities ! conceptual ! all right ! we . are . open for business ! [ all four of them sit in an empty booth with small dunder mifflin sign ] hello ! 
hello . hi . [ to pam ] can i talk to you for a sec ? excuse me . 
hey , uh , remember what we talked about , in the car on the way up , " only the best and the brightest . " 
he ' s totally wrong , pam . [ to justin ] hey . 
how you doing ? listen , i don ' t think that a handsome , funny , smart , funny - looking kid like you , should limit himself . you could do whatever you want to do . you could be a classy janitor , or a cashier with dignity , or a . . . migraine worker . [ takes back the info flyer justin holds ] maybe for you , paper should be more of a hobby . 
oh , no problem . [ looks down ] and he signed ! he put his name on the piece of - okay , that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams . and he just , made it into a stupid piece of paper . we need another one , immediately . 
are you mental ? 
i . . . don ' t . 
and that . is why . i need a smart intern . 
 [ teen approaches table ] hello there . 
well it ' s funny that you should ask , because it ' s really more than a company . . . 
dammit , oscar ! 
yeah , i ' m trying to lure these kids into my booth , but uh , kids are very wary about being " lured " these days . thank you dateline ! 
 [ answers cell ] what do you want ? 
who cares ? i ' m not there , jim ' s not there , why should they have to be there ? 
thank you ! [ pam hands him blank paper ] what , what is this ? 
this isn ' t dunder mifflin paper . some sort of pendleton crap . 
pam - pam - pam - pam - pampampampam ! we ' re dying here . i want you to go back to the office and i want you to get the real stuff . i want you to get ultra white card stock . 
yes . and don ' t call me shirley . 
all of these jobs ? suck . i would rather live jobless , on a beach somewhere , off the money from a large inheritance , than to have to work in any one of these crap - holes . they suck . 
hey ! [ walks up to oscar and darryl tossing basketballs , grabs oscar ' s ball ] game over . [ kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling ] 
 [ singsong ] just - in time . 
just - in case . what ' s your last name ? 
this . . . just in . justin polznik ! huh ? 
justin is the ugly girl in the movie , who takes off her glasses and she ' s hot ! and you realize she was always hot , she was just wearing glasses . and that you were the blind one . he ' s the most . . . important thing in my life right now . 
i want you to meet my family . come on . oscar martinez . accountant extraordinaire . this is justin . 
this is darryl philbin . isn ' t he big ? and you already met her , pam beesly , office hottie . she will " do " you . [ laughs ] no , no . but she has already dated two guys in the office , that we know of , so , this could be number three , you never know ? 
come here . i would never say this to her face , but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist . 
so , what do you think ? think these guys are nice ? the guys i didn ' t bring are even better . justin , i ' m willing to commit right now . would you do me the honor , of spending the summer with us , at dunder mifflin ? i think , i think you are very special . 
no , i didn ' t . you misconstrued me . 
i , uh , hmm . 
why don ' t . . . hey . 
hold down the fort , i have to do something . [ walks up to microphone ] excuse me . if you can hear me , i ' d like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you . h & amp ; r block ? come on , i mean i don ' t even know what they do . frank regan funeral home ? too much formaldehyde ! the air force ? [ airforce recruiter glares at michael ] air force is cool . the refreshments ? bush league ! you know , that ' s not what you want . dunder - they , well , okay i see security is coming so i just want to say , come to dunder mifflin . dunder mifflin , a great place to work ! anybody ? show of hands , anybody want to intern at dunder mifflin ? we do not offer college credit , we cannot give you any sort of pay , but it is a really fun work environment . anybody ? show of hands ? damn . . . it . okay , i ' m gonna wrap it up here . thank you for your time , and drive safe . 
today i did something stupid . i questioned myself . and i will never do that again . because i look at somebody like jim halpert and i think , that guy can do anything he wants to do . he could do anything , and he chooses to work here , selling paper . just like me . 
 [ standing way too close to jim and pam ] yeah , kiss her . kiss her good . [ jim and pam stop kissing ] 
well , kids today have a very short attention span . they are into texting and video games and sex , and they just , they get distracted easily . and today they ' re being distracted by the other booths . 
 [ clears throat ] hey , there ! michael scott , regional manager , dunder mifflin . 
that is a very firm handshake . ow , ow , aahch ! killing my hand , there . 
so , what is your poison ? you like uh , sales , accounting , customer service , what do you like . . . 
sales is and could be very , very cool . if you like paper , and you love to laugh , this is the place for you . 
right here . we have a lot of fun . 
 [ pam returns ] this is one of our staff . this is pam beesly , [ takes piece of paper from pam ] receptionist extraordinaire . 
check that out , huh ? 
pretty nice . 
she sits there all day . 
you get to look at her . why don ' t you hold out your hand . [ hands brad paper ] tell me what you feel . 
that ' s called card stock . that ' s what you ' re feeling . now what you ' re feeling inside is confusion , butterflies , exhilaration . . . you ' re thinking , " am i good enough for this job ? do i have what it takes ? " and i think we both know the answer . we ' ll find that out together . you can keep that . 
mmm , yeah . 
don ' t fold it , though . 
we have the dundies , my birthday , those blow out , and it ' s sexy , it ' s sort of a sexy atmosphere , you know ? the other day , in the parking lot , i actually found a condom . so . [ to pam ] i ' ve been meaning to ask you , do you know whose that was ? [ pam shakes head no ] so , sexy is fun . . . 
hey , you know what ? coincidence - i am going to go for a little stroll myself . are you psyched about the summer ? 
yeah , me , too . 
okay , be my guest . 
and do your worst . 
 [ to brad coming out of the bathroom ] hey . 
so , i forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss , so , gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this . . . 
one other thing i wanted to . . . 
 [ laughs ] ohh . . . nah . 
hey , justin ! 
wait , you want this kid to be in the air force ? 
time out . you think this kid could be a fighter pilot ? 
okay . 
have you given any more thought to dunder mifflin ? 
well , yeah , but you don ' t need the brochure . the brochure is up here [ indicates head ] and it ' s in here . [ indicates heart ] 
i think you are smart , and capable , and you aim high . 
i ' m right . 
today is toby flenderson ' s last day . i couldn ' t sleep last night . i came extra - early . so much energy . . . there are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life , and i just have a feeling that today is one of those days . 
mornin ' . [ to camera ] so here we go , just a matter of hours now , until his horribleness has left the building . i ' m going to set my watch alarm . . . and . . . [ watch beeps ] 
first thing on the agenda - actually , the only thing on the agenda , is the status of toby ' s going away party . 
okay . 
okay , well , this will not do . toby is going away forever , and uh , we need to do something very very special . in some cultures , when somebody leaves , like new orleans culture , they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets . . . 
if the devil were to explode , and evil were gone forever , what sort of party would you have ? 
like a beach blowout ? or a toga , toga - 
toga ! 
i thought that you might say that . [ takes off his shoe ; hums ; takes out cash from shoe ] 
every year , my sweet , sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars . and lately , she has been sending me , like nine or ten checks a year . . . uh , as nana starts to . . . but , i knew i should be saving it for something , i just didn ' t know what i should be saving it for . and then i had an awakening . " michael , buy a motorcycle . " so i put the money in my shoe , and then i forgot about it until now . 
i want a party that makes me feel like i am flying through the air without this . . . ugly weight holding me down , you know ? . . . i want an antigravity machine . i saw it in a movie . you drink a potion , and then you just start floating all around . 
phyllis , can you do this ? 
 [ watching from his office ] toby ' s replacement . ugh . wow . 
well , we know that toby thinks she ' ll be great . so , strike one , i hate her already . 
why do you hate her ? 
you know , dwight , sometimes . . . i don ' t know , i think you say things just to agree with me . 
yeah ! it would ! just have a thought . have an original thought . although , i will agree that her head is weird . you know what we need to do ? 
we need to sell her an elevator pass . 
exactly . a little old - fashioned hazing . 
 [ knock on door ] yeah . 
oh , hey , do you still work here ? 
nah . 
no . i think i will pass . 
hi . yeah . right . okay , well , they hired a female toby . good for the world . thank you , god , for creating two of you . here ' s how things work here : my job is to make the office fun . your job is to make the office lame . and we have an eternal struggle , you and i . and only one of us can be the winner . spoiler alert : i ' m gonna win . 
yeah . 
t - no . he tortured me . . . with his awfulness . 
y - you can - michael . 
thanks to toby , i have a very strong prejudice against human resources . i believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters . what i failed to consider though , is that not all monsters are bad . like e . t . is holly our extraterrestrial ? maybe . or maybe she ' s just an awesome woman from this planet . 
here she is ! holly . . . you know , if we hung holly from the ceiling , we ' d have to kiss underneath of her . so - i know . oh , sorry . question , are you real , or are you a hollygram ? 
i bet . 
i bet . are these guys boring your ears off ? 
oh . . . what , um , what is your commute like ? how long does it take to get in ? 
you know , i should make you a mix . do you have a , uh , a cd player ? 
all right . 
yep . 
 [ listening to " crash into me " on his computer ] hmm . . . jim ? [ jim comes into his office ] i am downloading some n3p . . . 
music . . . 
for a cd mix tape . . . 
for holly . 
and i ' m looking for perfect songs that work on two levels . 
the two levels being , uh , " welcome to scranton " . . . 
and " i . . . love you . " 
hey , what ' s the group that was from scranton that made it big ? was that u2 ? 
i think i do . 
well , it was love at first sight . actually , it was - no , it was when i heard her voice . it was love at first see with my ears . 
well , you ' re not a romantic . 
oh really ? 
like , with who ? 
pam ? 
yeah , you took it too slow . 
this thing with holly feels a lot like love to me . 
i don ' t want her to get away . 
hello , holly . [ holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces ] woah , what are you doing ? you don ' t , uh , you don ' t have to do that . i mean , we have already put - together chairs . that ' s how we buy them actually . 
and the sequel , " woman stands at desk and works . " so , i have no idea how you , [ he sits on the floor ] how you sit like that . 
 [ as yoda ] sit on floor and put together chair we will . [ laughs nervously ] yo - da . um . . . 
so are you in down this weekend ? cause , i ' m not - i ' m not . . . i ' m not gonna be in town . i ' m going out of town . 
kidding . [ overdramatically ] acting ! 
 [ overdramatically ] acting ! 
yeah . 
i did it ! [ exhales ] 
i talked to her - holly . just pleasantries , nothing , you know . . . not like , do you want kids or , religion , or what side of the bed do you want . hey , i can take either side of the bed at this point . 
it was hard . i wanted to kiss her . 
whew , oh god . [ inhales ] laying a base . laying a base . . . 
 [ giddy ] yeah . . . 
oh , there he is . thought you had gone home already . why don ' t you go home , and come back for the party ? 
yes we do . 
i ' ll let you in on a little secret : i ' ve been very much looking forward to this moment . very , very much . i - i have been steeped in anticipation . toby has been cruisin ' for a bruisin ' for twelve years , and i am now his cruise director , and my name is captain bruisin ' . 
can i just say that , of all the idiots , in all the idiot villages , in all the idiot worlds , you stand alone , my friend . 
hey ! hi , good to see you . 
i ' m just having a little exit interview . 
um , no , no , no . this is very boring stuff . why don ' t you take a tour ? have you seen the baler ? 
okay . 
um . . . alright , well then , i will proceed . [ takes out note cards ] i just have some questions that i was gonna ask . um . . . who do you think you are ? 
yeah . correct . um . . . what gives - what - what gives you the right ? 
sure . you know what ? that sounds good . i ' ll take a little look - see . 
thank you . [ reads ] what would you improve about dunder mifflin ? 
well , no no no no no . . . 
no no no no no . i ' m not asking it . i ' m just reading it out loud . 
 [ hides his face from holly ; whispers to toby ] i ' ll kill you . 
oh , no no no , no , no . no , this - hey , hey , hey , hey , this might not be what i think . . . that i don ' t even know is in there , because there are a lot of presents in my car , and i don ' t know which is which . . . 
what the hell is that ? 
that ' s . . . what do you mean , " michael " ? that ' s not even my handwriting . [ exits conference room ] hey ! what the hell is going on here ? ! who thought it would be hysterical to give toby a rock for his going - away gift ? ! 
no ! 
okay , you know what that is ? you know what that is ? that is . . . a psyche . psyche . so , that is not my real gift to toby . 
my gift is forthcoming , pam . 
i am going to give toby . . . 
 . . . yes , i am . that was it . how did you know that ? 
how did you know ? 
well . . . that ' s my watch . 
hey , that ' s good . 
 [ still watching video of ryan ] oh my god . ryan . . . oh my god . 
 [ voice straining ] i ' m just worried about my friend . 
just , i ' m fine . i ' m holding it together . i - i have a business to run . 
i ' m cool . 
holly is sweet and simple , like a lady baker . i would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here . she has that kind of warmth . i ' m pretty sure she ' s baked on a professional level . 
no antigravity machine , huh ? 
ferris wheel ' s pretty cool though . 
that ' s what she . . . a lot of places are like that . 
thanks . 
i like , uh . . . 
hey . what are you doing ? 
what the hell is going on here ? ! 
there is a raccoon in the car , dwight ! 
why did you do that ? 
no . there is no such thing as playful hazing . dwight , i want you to look at holly right now . everybody , i want you to look at holly right now , and maybe if you look at her deeply enough , you will see what i see in her . and that is that we are all very lucky to have her here . holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since world war ii . fifty years , she is the best . [ to dwight ] take care of that , all right ? 
shh . . . 
i ' m really sorry . 
yeah . . . 
did you see that ! did you see it ? did you see what . . . wow - wee ! uh , well , jan didn ' t believe in showing affection , so . . . sometimes i don ' t know how to react when a girl touches me . oh . . . i like it ! [ giggles ] 
 [ on microphone ] alright ! let ' s hear it for darryl and his band . [ applause ] you know what ? let ' s also give a shout - out to phyllis for this awesome party , huh ? 
probably the best one that we have ever had , right ? [ cheers and applause ] but the real reason that we are here , is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again . now , a lot of you know that i am an accomplished songwriter . 
i have done things like um , " beers in heaven . " 
or , " total eclipse of the fart . " 
i love to sing them , but i am not going to be doing that today . i am going to be doing something i wrote specifically for toby . [ to band ] do you know , um , " goodbye stranger " ? supertramp ? 
 [ sings ] it was early morning yesterday . . . i was up before the dawn . . . and i really have enjoyed my stay . . . toby must be movin ' on . 
 [ singing ] goodbye toby , it ' s been nice . hope you find your paradise . . . 
 [ singing , screaming into the mic ] come tomorrow , feel no pain ! feel no pain ! toby ! toby ! tobee - yy ! toby ' s goin ' away ! see ya ! he ' s outta here ! see ya ! he ' s outta here ! ohh ! goodbye toby ! goodbye toby ! goodbye toby ! goodbye tooo - by ! 
oh , hey . thanks . 
oh , okay . yeah . well , actu - too soon . it ' s uh , it ' s uh , very sexual . [ cell phone rings ] sorry . kevin . [ answers ] kevin , where are you ? you missed my song , buddy .

 [ follows jim into bathroom ] you have to agree with me . [ follows jim back out ] that ' s insane . 
i thought you had to pee .

are you kidding me ? we only lost one pound , phyllis . 
what is wrong with these people ? they have no willpower . i went - - i once went 28 years without having sex . and then again for seven years . 
does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country ? 
no . 
thank you . holly is right . people , this is not just about winning some extra vacation days . this is about a very cool hr initiative that if we don ' t follow , we are all going to die of obesity . so how much are we gonna lose ? 
yes , all right . who else ? [ to angela ] can i put you down for 10 pounds ? 
if you gain weight , you will die . i want you to live forever . i want us all to live forever . how ? how are we going to do this ?

booty call .

wait a second . [ removes condom from wallet , throws it to jim ] i don ' t want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me . 
you want more ? 
 [ music playing ] it ' s a pretty lame party . 
you know what we should do ? we should have a party and not invite them . 
let ' s go mini - golfing . 
uh . . . 
um , i think you ' ll have fun . men from scranton are handsome , and they know how to show a woman a good time . 
you know what ? we ' re pretty much done here today . why don ' t you just take off early ? 
yeah . 
good luck . 
oh , holly doesn ' t need luck . everyone that meets her instantly loves her . 
ok , everybody . phyllis , did i or did i not say fruit ? 
and what is that ? 
you know , we ' re gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing . 
ronnie was bleh . things were at an all time sad here . but then i got an e - mail from ryan , that he was coming back to town . and i called the temp agency and i told them i will pay you any amount , just give me ryan howard . give him to me . i want him . i need him . 
i did ! 
yes . gooooo - tee ! 
hey , you know what ? i can ' t do this by myself people ! kelly and i are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out . [ flails his arms ] 
 [ groans painfully ] 
 [ struggling to speak ] mmm - - - mmm . . . um . . . 
close the door . this is your fault . 
your stupid friend zone . 
i should have been lovers with her first and then friends . that was terrible advice . terrible advice ! you know my seduction method . i like to get in there and get my hands dirty ! wh - - - you sabotaged me . you sabotaged me , man ! 
mmm - hmm . saunas . 
gah , the dreadmill . [ both laugh ] 
 [ in a fat suit , speaking in his michael clump voice ] ohhhh ! bang ! boom ! say clump ! why hello everybody ! 
i say , i say , i say , i say down holly ! i ' ll take it from here . i am beautiful . [ hangs pictures of fat people on the wall , including two fat people on a bike , the ghostbusters marshmallow man , elvis , martin lawrence in big mamma ' s house , jabba the hutt , and a fat pig ] they are beautiful . he is beautiful . this big fat pig is beautiful . 
it ' s my sumo suit . i just didn ' t inflate it all the way . i am so glad that i bought instead of rented . 
body image . we are here because there is something wrong with society . 
if it ' s me , then society made me that way . now , i know a lot of you are probably asking yourself , " why are you dressed in a plus sized suit ? " 
how do you know michael clump ? 
how dare you ! michael clump is a celebration of fat people . 
no , no , no , no , no ! you know what ? fat people are not monsters ! why don ' t you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject . bang ! boom ! case in point ! look at the outside of this building . it is ugly . but you come inside . . . and it is beautiful . just like this unappealing fat suit . inside is a rather handsome , sexy , man . 
hey ! why don ' t you just sit down , please ? 
we ' re doing this because of you . so why don ' t you just go stand somewhere else . [ to ryan ] hey . hey . you shaved ? 
why ? 
dwight , i would like you to apologize to this beautiful , beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles , which for her is basically a death march . 
ok phyllis , thank dwight first . 
you ' re right , you ' re right . just , dwight , do it . just say it ok . 
finally . right ? ok , phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams . why don ' t you have a seat ? [ phyllis sits ] let ' s all clap at phyllis . [ everyone claps ] ok ! [ in michael clump voice ] when michael clump wants to remind you [ normal voice ] that corporate . . . their idea , yes , was to urge you to lose weight , but more importantly what this whole thing is about , this contest is really about being healthy . and in order to be healthy , you have to eat , kelly . kelly . [ kneels down in front of kelly , dwight tries to help him down , michael shouts gibberish at him ] kelly , i want you to stand up on your chair . come on , stand up on your chair . stand up , stand up , stand up . somebody help her . here we go . [ kelly stands up on her chair ] ok , i want you to look at her . she ' s a beautiful indian woman . why ? what makes her beautiful ? 
ok , be more specific . 
what about her looks ? 
kelly , will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself ? 
i want you to know . kelly , look at me ! i want you to know that you are beautiful . you are truly , truly beautiful . give me a hug . [ michael hugs kelly , his head in her chest ] mmmmmm . 
hey ryan , look . shaved off my goatee . i am goateeless . we are the goateeless brothers . 
ahaha , yep ! [ dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee ] 
oscar , enough with the girl talk please .

we ' re trying to win a contest here , kelly . please ? 
ok , that is fine . just water , and be back by weigh - in , ok ? 
aww , really ? 
i have to say , i think the problem with that whole thing . . . 
 . . . was that he was a complete stupid idiot . 
i know . i love counting crows . 
wow , really ? 
that ' s a shame . a shame to waste these . i want to buy them from you . 
i do . no . i do . i , i want to . trust me . i really do . 
ok ? 
alright . alright ! [ tears up tickets ] just , i want you to just forget about him , ok ? case closed . umm , can i pay you tomorrow ? i have like a 60 dollar limit on my atm , so . . . 
is that good ? 
ok . 
darryl , would you do the honors ? 
nonono , no , no , i don ' t want to hear moaning . this is a good day . you guys accomplished something big . you lost a ton of weight , literally . a lot of weight . and i don ' t care what any stupid scale says . you guys are all gigantic losers . 
no , you know what we ' re gonna do ? we ' re gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition . 
hello , hello . hey ! your face is almost back to normal . 
hey , oscar ! come on , let ' s go ! 
i am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year . 
okay , no , i am not . dwight ! [ dwight runs into michael ' s office ] i want you to take jim ' s chair . no ! no ! his chair at his desk . he gets it back on friday . 
i want you to get your ass out of my face . 
 [ from his office ] that ' s what she said . 
well . . . 
you ' re . . . you know what ? i read in one of those books that you ' re not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor . 
i ' m digging . 
i can ' t wait to be a father . i ' m going to smother that baby . 
i really , i don ' t want to get panty liners , please . . . 
i know , it ' s . . . 
yes . 
i want you to get the panty liners . 
 [ walking in ] what ' s going on ? 
 [ to jim ] to be married ? 
woo ! alright ! 
 " why are you helping her ? you ' re not even dating . " she ' s my friend . . . and . . . ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship . . . without her even knowing . uh . . . 
ok , let ' s give it for miss . . . holly flaaaax ! [ everyone claps ] 
 [ clapping ] ok . well done . good speech ryan , you ' re a good guy . 
well , i think we can all totally agree that holly is totally fantastic . [ claps ] 
 [ to holly ] can ' t set ' em up like that . 
can we have a moment ? [ whispering ] can i talk to you for a sec ? lot of good stuff . and you look . . . you look fantastic . 
yeah . 
do some . . . do some work . [ whispering to holly ] people expect a lot from these meetings . laughter , sudden twists . surprise endings . you need to be robin williams and m . night shyamalan . you need to be robin shyamalan . 
do you . . . just . . . you ' re kind of losing them . 
yeah , don ' t think about the stakes . it ' ll freak you out . 
 [ coughs to hide his words ] lauren , [ coughs ] enough with the pencils . 
i would not . . . steal the bread . and i would not let my family go hungry . 
anybody ? this is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions . stanley ? oscar , come on . 
i will go first . when i discovered youtube i didn ' t work for five days . i did nothing . i viewed cookie monster sings chocolate rain about a thousand times . 
to tell you or not . and i ' m glad i did . i feel very very good . cathartic . i promise you that you are not going to get into trouble . you can say anything you want with total and complete immunity . 
yeah , [ interrupting gibberish ] . come on , anybody . let it fly . 
a siesta ! 
you are a thief of joy . anybody else . yeah ? 
who hasn ' t ? good . good ! what else ? 
mmm . . .

bruuuuuuuuuce . 
ach ! wuh - - - 
that ' s crazy . that ' s crazy talk ! meredith ! the merenator , sleepin ' with suppliers ! hoo - ooh ! wow ! what time we got ? [ checks watch ] you know what ? that ' s a good place to end it . right there . this , i think , was a great ethics seminar . she has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about . right . . . what is wrong . who ' s to say ? really . in the end . i mean because it is . . . unknowable . but , let ' s give her a round of applause . holly , everybody . holly ! get back to work . [ everyone applauds , then leaves ] [ to holly ] great job . i am truly impressed . that , uh , you really pulled that one out . classic . classic meeting . we should celebrate . 
oh . . . 
nnyeah . what ya gonna do ? 
meredith , why don ' t you tell holly . . . it ' s not what she thinks . nothing unethical happened . . . and that you just like to sleep around . 
no . . . no , this is just a stupid formality . 
ughh ! for the love of god we ' re trying to help you . . . stupid bag . 
well , well . holly . . . lujah ! it ' s a miracle , you ' re at your desk . 
hoo - ooh ! reaching ! you ' ll get there . anyway , i was giving it some thought , and there ' s no reason that two attractive , good looking , intelligent , funny , attractive people can ' t , you know , just . . . sit down and work this whole meredith thing out . 
good . would you care to bang it out over lunch ? 
oh no , no , no . your food is no good here , my lady . [ sweeps her food into the trash can , misses ] sorry ! you know what ? let ' s go out ! dunder mifflin ' s treat . um , actually you ' re not a client . . . so . . . we ' ll just split it ? ethical . 
what do you think ? what do you think of this place ? 
istn ' t it ? yeah , it ' s kind of . . . business / romantic . so you ' re from des moines ? 
wow , that sounds so . . . warm . 
here too . you know what my favorite season is ? 
yeah , get the boring stuff out of the way . autumn was what i was going to say . when the leaves change . it ' s just , i . . . i think it is the most contemplative of seasons . 
wow , terminator , terminator . 
yeah . 
i just don ' t want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance . i mean , what sort of place is that to call home ? and meredith needs this job . this is her main source of money . 
ok , new idea . we don ' t report it at all . we just punish her . 
mmhmm , tell her she can ' t have sex for six months . 
i don ' t know . i saw this thing , like a belt with a key . 
no , it ' s more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of , sometimes they are made of metal . you know what i am talking about . you unlock a little door that . . . down . . . where you , where you put , where you put the . . . 
i am just saying that i don ' t think that you understand what i am saying . 
yes . 
well . . . bleh busted . i don ' t . . . 
well , you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family . 
i will be honest with you . that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault . the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i don ' t want to take the elevator with her . and i am holding on to her leftovers . [ throws holly ' s leftovers in the trash ] 
what ' s the only thing worse than one hr rep ? 
you get me . 
i don ' t know . can you ? kendall , my main man . 
let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar . 
how do you tell somebody that you care about deeply , " i told you so . " gently with a rose ? in a funny way , like it ' s a hilarious joke ? or do you just let it go , because saying it would just make things worse ? . . . probably the funny way . 
ok , everybody listen up . if you are not in that conference room in two minutes i am going to kill you . 
get in there right now or i ' m gonna lose it ! [ everyone gets up to go in the conference room ] 
now is really not the time , meredith . 
let ' s keep this rollin ' . . . ryan ? 
oh , cr . . . , oh , god . meredith , you know what ? i just need a minute , okay ? 
what do you need ? 
i . . . really want to keep you . 
wait , what ? 
nnnngah ! 
yeah . 
ok , just remember to keep breathing . 
ok , good . 
oh , ok ! ok ! 
i get a call from jan and i meet her at the hospital . 
i take quincy ave to gibson . 
i checked the route - there are no potholes . come on , get in here and have the baby . 
 [ annoyed ] andy , would you like to have my baby ? 
all right , ok . [ to andy ] sorry . sorry . here we go . here we go ! 
do it ! do it ! scream ! scream it out , scream it out , scream it out . 
aaaaaaaa ! 
just keep pushing . . . 
i ' m right here . 
i ' m right here , i ' m right here . 
 [ annoyed ] all right . dwight . just push and breathe . 
shhh . no , you can ' t have it . it ' s too late . 
no . you have to just push it out ! 
keep simulating . 
ok ! 
keep simulating . 
yes , i do ! 
ok . 
yes . 
aaaaaaaa ! it ' s coming ! here we go ! [ drops the watermelon onto the floor ] oh ! god ! wow ! what was on that ? 
nice touch . good . let ' s try that again . 
 [ eating the watermelon ] it is going to be the happiest day of my life . [ dwight gets dressed behind michael and zips his fly ] 
hello ladies , how ' s my shower going ? phyllis , did you get the live storks ? 
damnit , phyllis ! i ' m sorry . [ more softly ] damnit , phyllis . it was hard enough to convince jan to come . so are we set for refreshments ? 
she said it is the name of a viking princess . so . . . 
i know . i know . it is beautiful . no . thank you . is this it ? i mean , is this . . . two bowls of m & amp ; ms and some balloons ? you know what phyllis , i think you need to step it up . i think you need to get the lead out . because if i ' m not mistaken , we gave you your wedding shower here . we all came into this room and gave you a golden shower . well you know what , where ' s my golden shower , phyllis ? 
it does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine . i am going to love it . it ' s like when the dog nurses the tiger cub . have you seen that video ? it is . . . it ' s so bizarre and unnatural , but . . . it , it happens . 
 [ banging on the glass ] hey , hey . what are you doing ? don ' t talk to them . 
make the party . don ' t - make the party , please , phyllis . [ phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump ] pump it ! 
ahoy , matey . 
ahoy . so , how you doin ' ? 
um , listen . jan levinson is coming in today , and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which i have a vested interest . it ' s all kind of weird . anyway , she is incredibly . . . fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive . and you are , on the other hand , one of the more attractive people in the office . so , while she ' s here i am going to be acting kind of cold to you . and i am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings . and i ' m treating ryan the same way . 
so this is astird . 
oh , ok . why didn ' t you call me ? 
i could have helped . 
oh , man . him ? that guy ? he had no sense of humor and i proved him wrong in so many ways . 
no , i don ' t ! 
can i hold her ? 
 [ cradling the car seat awkwardly ] all right , ok . 
i love babies . i think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways . i try to pick up and hold a baby every day , if possible , because it nourishes me . it feeds my soul . babies are drawn to me , and i think it ' s because they see me as one of them . but cooler , and with my life put together a little bit . if a baby were president , there would be no taxes , there would be no war . there would be no government , and things could get terrible . it actually , probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion . 
 [ carrying the car seat ] ladies and gentlemen , it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office : assst . . . 
 . . . trid levinson . hi ! astrid , this is everybody , look . this is your family . you ' re going to know them for the rest of your life . 
 [ looking at creed ] well , he may not be here . say hello ! ok , here we go . [ lifting the car seat high above his head ] lion king ! 
ok , come on , let ' s get our shower on . conference room , choppity chip chop . 
 [ sees jan sizing up holly ] i ' m fine , weirdo . such an hr weirdo . try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in . 
ready to play some games ? let ' s do it ! 
uh , duh . 
no , the baby doesn ' t ruin anything , kevin , ok ? the baby multiplies the fun . let ' s just do what you were going to do . 
all right , how about some presents ? i want to see some presents . [ holding a memo pad ] i got this so i can write down for thank - you notes . 
whatta we got ? 
oh ! 
she already has a stroller . 
ok , what else ? 
hey ! hey , no no no no no no no no . no . no . this is the birth story . it was beautiful . it was beautiful . this is a once - in - a - lifetime experience . and i should have been there . i should have been there to witness this . 
i could have helped . 
 [ smiling ] uh , yeah . 
 [ voiceover ] i usually love babies , but when i held astrid i just felt . . . shortchanged . 
phyllis ? could you take - . 
hey guys . 
uh , i need some advice from one baby daddy to another . 
yeah , i a baby daddy . um , when you first became a baby daddy , did you have an immediate connection with that baby ? like , the first time that you held it , did you find that with your baby baby ? 
i just saw this baby daddy - 
why , darryl , because i ' m quote white quote unquote ? 
well - 
it ' s - that ' s different . 
that ' s not a baby . 
 [ sighs ] could i ? 
 [ sees holly behind jan ] i was just going to . . . i was going to talk to holly , about her hygiene . she smells like old tomatoes and dirt . 
sure you can ' t stay a little longer ? 
all right . all right , everybody , we ' re leaving . jan and astrid are leaving . 
ok ? 
wha - that ' s , i hate her . wha - god ! why would you even ask me to - i , i mean , not that it matters , ' cause i don ' t , but wha - ok , all right , fine . 
all right . 
 [ just hugs her , and she hugs him back and smiles ] you wanna go out ? 
i didn ' t feel much when i held astrid , but i got a good feeling from holly . 
oh ! ok ! 
seventeen . i say seventeen squares . 
do the boobs ! 
hey ! hr lady , stop whispering in the corner please . very rude . you ' re ruining the party . 
 [ on phone ] paaam - o - laaaaaa . . . 
 [ on phone ] paaam - o - laaaaaa . . . miss ya kiddo . miss you . . . so much . 
hey . 
that was really fun last night . 
i ' m actually thinking about getting my own set of putt - putt golf clubs . 
yeah ? 
oh really ? 
well . . . 
i , uh . . . [ to camera ] i let her win . 
so , when , um , can i see you again ? 
no . 
okay . oh , wait , oh , tonight ' s no good . [ holly ' s smile quickly fades ] because i am busy taking you out . 
 [ concerned ] why ? 
wow . . . oh , wait a second , i can ' t tonight . . . 
tonight ' s so . . . 
too many times . it ' s all good , um , alright , so , good , so , have a nice day . 
you ' re welcome . 
in my opinion , the third date is traditionally the one where . . . you have sex . does holly feel that way ? i don ' t know . i will probably find out tonight . if she starts having sex with me i ' ll know for sure . 
yeah . 
some of what we order depends on whether we ' re having sex after . [ laughs ] oh , my . wow , elephant in the room . are we , do you think ? do you think we ' re going to have sex tonight ? 
okay , so , we do the restaurant thing and then . . . then . . . then we can do . . . we ' ll just do the restaurant thing first . 
probably get soup or something light . 
no . no . reservations are at 8 : 00 , so we ' ve got like an hour and 45 minutes . [ sighs ] [ goofy voice ] i ' m a crazy eight , i ' m crazy . 
do you need ' em ? 
all right .

and i ' m out a fiancee . are those the customer surveys ? 
i ' ll take care of that for you . [ crumples receipt and throws it in trash ] thanks . 
kelly kapoor is our dusky , exotic customer service rep . and once a year , she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople . sort of a kapoor ' s list . " schindler ' s list " parody . . . . that ' s not appropriate , no . 
alrighty , dwighty , let ' s see how you did . 
no . 
wow . 
dwight , your feedback is horrible . 
a number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful . 
no , no , no , no , no . 
do i look like i am joking ? 
if i were joking , you would be laughing . do you look like you are laughing ? 
you ' re not . 
jimbo , let ' s do this thang . 
oh , come on . 
you too ? 
jim , they are a poopy . [ jim coughs , presses button to end call on bluetooth ] 
no . [ glances at it ] yes , i am sure , jim . it - - 
i agree . 
so let ' s see what we can find out from reading . [ reads ] jim halpert is smudge and arrogant . 
 [ points at jim ] arrogance . 
and there ' s our smudgeness . 
here ' s what ' s going to happen . i am going to have to fix you , manage you two on a more personal scale , a more micro form of management . jim , what is that called ? 
boom ! yes . now , jim is going to be the client . dwight , you ' re going to have to sell to him without being aggressive , hostile or difficult . let ' s go . 
 [ whispers ] ask him his name . 
be respectful , dwight . 
it ' s up to you to change his mind . 
boundaries , dwight . come on ! 
he ' s hard of - - he ' s an old man . let ' s go . 
stop it ! stop it ! 
that is totally inappropriate . you never yell at the client . you never yell at the client . 
here we go . 
give me the phone . 
give me the phone . 
give me the phone . give me the phone . 
hello , this is michael scott , regional manager . 
hello , mr . buttlicker . how may we help you ? 
 [ covers phone , whispers to dwight ] see how it ' s done ? [ into phone ] thank you very much , sir . i don ' t think you ' ll regret it . [ to dwight ] see what i did ? 
yes . 
 . . . [ whispers ] it ' s a million - dollar sale . 
why don ' t you tell us ? 
dwight . [ to kelly ] i was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate . 
what ' s going on ? 
 [ looks momentarily flattered , but thinks better of it ] kelly . 
you cannot say " i was raped " and expect all of your problems to go away , kelly . not again . don ' t keep doing that . i ' ll give you one last chance to come clean . just tell me what happened . 
don ' t . don ' t . get away from that , dwight , please . you know what ? she ' s got a point about you two . you do have a problem dealing with people . 
you were lying . 
yes . jim , dwight , please excuse us . 
i will call you when it is time . [ jim and dwight leave ] 
i have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place . and i hate it . i can ' t tell you how much leftover guacamole i have ended up eating over the years . i don ' t even know why i make it in such great quantities . here ' s what we ' re gonna do . we are going to sit here for a while , make it look good . and maybe you should cry . can you make yourself cry ? 
i think you should do that . [ kelly starts fake - crying , then laughing , then she and michael both laugh ] 
how did i propose , let me see . . . well , i drove her up to nashua , and i had the ring , a big 10 - carat diamond ; it was beautiful . and i got down on my hands and knees , and a shooting star crossed overhead , and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star . and we were in a restaurant , and i put the diamond into a cheeseburger . 
and she took a bite , started to choke . so what do i do ? i have cpr training . go around , start doing the heimlich . 
the ring , 10 - carat diamond , pops out of her mouth , hits her shrimp cocktail , right onto her finger . million - to - one shot . all of the greek people in the restaurant start screaming " opa ! " which means " congratulations , " so . . . 
i ' m pretty much devastated . 
maybe go to sandals , jamaica . or the other sandals , jamaica . i just don ' t want to go by myself . 
why are surveys important ? okay , hypothetical : a man wants to buy 500 reams of . . . . carrots . and , so he ' s like " what do i do ? where do i go ? do i go to the insensitive carrot supplier , the insensitive carrot salesman ? or do i go to the nice carrot salesman , who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot , but guarantee next - day delivery on your carrots ? most companies need their carrots the next day . now , substitute paper for carrots , and that is why surveys are important . " 
great marks , phyllis . [ phyllis walks out of michael ' s office smiling ] 
i taught jim and dwight everything i know about sales . but there are certain things that cannot be taught , and it is these things that i now must teach them . 
attention , all problem sales persons . jim halpert . . . dwight schrute . . . 
intensive one - on - one retraining will begin after lunch . that is all . 
did you know that in morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time ? in japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment . in italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom . this is considered to be polite . 
i am jetting off on an international business trip . 
to can - a - da . 
canada . 
my boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and i have always been intrigued by all things international . the women , the pancakes , the man of mystery . . . 
meredith , i would like you to pretend that you are from abu dhabi . 
i am ashamed at your naked face . i must cover it with my jacket . [ covers meredith ' s face with his jacket ] you are now sexy in your culture . 
i have my passport . [ pats jacket pocket ] 
i have my per diem . [ holds up money ] i already know what i am going to spend this on . i am going to buy a sweater . 
well i ' ll just . . . i ' ll use different money for that . 
and business class air , like a five - star hotel in the sky , nothing but the best . actually better than a five - star hotel ' cause you get a big , cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat , whatever the mind can imagine . i think i am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce . 
well that is all in the past . 
they have one of those ? 
 [ in a singsong voice ] lets do this ! 
two are for souvenirs .

no , i don ' t want to wear a bra .

you want one of your own ? i can hook you up . 
yes , this is beth . this is my personal valet / flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning .

 [ whisper ] hey . . . guys , check it out . my own personal dvd player and 20 movies . 
shhhh ! keep it down . 
could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane ? [ andy laughs ] my god , oscar . really ? do you have a bag of baby poop in there too , to share with everybody ? no , i will be ordering my own food , thank you very much . 
 [ to stewardess ] hi . 
um . i ' d like to see a menu please . 
oh . . . okay . [ looks back at andy and oscar ] doesn ' t matter , because i am going to take a nap . i think i am going to use my complimentary blindfold . i will don it . . . and oh ! look at that . i can ' t see because i am in a - - [ cart crashes into michael ' s leg ] gah !

okay . 
yes ! wallace said there would be one of those . 
wow ! 
wow ! wow , i am blown away by this . i , um . . . i - - ah ! this is great , thank you ! 
a concierge is like the winnipeg equivalent of a geisha . this is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure . and when you meet one , it is intoxicating . just what the doctor ordered . 
guys , she ' s in there . 
let ' s do this . 
 [ goes up to concierge from the hotel ] excuse me , hello . concierge marie . michael scott . good to see you again . 
um , this is my associate uh , from dunder mifflin , uh , oscar martinez . 
works in accounting . this is uh , concierge marie . . . 
 . . . who works at our hotel . you look , how do you say , radiant tonight . 
and it is , how do you say , a beautiful night - - - 
she ' s foreign . i am - - 
oh , thank you . 
thank you , andy . 
everyone is going to end up dying someday . and i think it ' s better to die with people you like . . . like oscar , and andy , and concierge marie . . . than to know that there ' s somebody out there that you love that you ' re not with . 
how about this one ? it ' s christmas eve - - - 
 - - - and everything ' s closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done . 12 : 00 midnight . where do you go ? what do you do ? what do you do ? come on ! what do you do ? 
unbelievable ! unbelievable . 
 [ standing outside hotel room . . . whispering ] do you want to get some breakfast or something ? 
okay . 
slept like a baby . 
look , people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here . they feel respected and they feel that their needs matter . they are treated like human beings . [ sighs ] 
yes . 
yeah , we locked him up for two years . 
no . actually the trip sucked . 
the trip sucked , david . it blew chunks . it was terrible . it was a bad trip . 
i did not like the trip . well , starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van . 
and business class which was basically just coach . and the hotel which sucked big time . 
it was not , it sucked . 
oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige . that was great . that was great . that was - - - that was a - - - 
that was a really good choice . 
no , david . you listen to me . why did you send her away ? that - - - god . you knew i liked her and you just sent her away . and that - - - that was a sucky thing to do man . 
that was a really sucky thing to do . 
why have i stayed at dunder mifflin for so long ? certainly not because of the paycheck . ' cause i could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete . i think it ' s because they respect me . a boss that will not fire you , even though you just tell him off . . . right to his face . . . over the hone . that ' s respect . 
oh brownies ! i ' m taking two so i can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on , much healthier . 
yeah why don ' t you send that to him in costa rica ? 
heh , okay , weirdo . 
she said she was going to give it to him right now . [ starts laughing ] 
yeah , they used to . 
oh , can you imagine ? 
uhhgh . 
i don ' t know . what ? 
hmmm , dare i ? [ laughs ] you know what ? i ' m going to , for old time ' s sake . [ walks to the annex , standing in toby ' s cubicle ] great practical joke jim , you got me to go to the annex . [ turns around and sees toby ] 
noooo ! god ! no , god , please no ! no ! no ! nooo ! 
 [ watching toby at phyllis ' desk through his office blinds ] look at him . with his stupid face . stupid . . . tan . no . 
no . 
he looks worse . 
uh , well i ' m afraid not . toby flenderson , of h . r . , has made a sudden reappearance . 
not on the surface , no , but i can tell people are disturbed , david . 
yes . 
i learned a while back that if i don ' t text 911 people will not return my calls . um , but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened . 
i did not want to go back to the annex because that is where holly worked whom i loved . 
that ' s true . people say it ' s icky . 
david , wait . 
is there no way we can get rid of him ? 
i have cause . it is be - cause i hate him . 
no . 
i don ' t . 
 [ dwight comes over , starts to massage michael ' s shoulders ] don ' t do that . 
you want to see some really high caliber acting ? well , mr . kurt russell , you are about to be served . [ walks to the annex ] hey toby , great to have you back , man . seriously , just a , just a real pleasure to see you again . 
you ' re welcome . missed you . missed you as part of our family . 
so costa rica that was - did you have fun ? that must have been fun . 
nice beaches , pristine beaches ? 
why ' d you come back ? why didn ' t you stay ? 
i bet , for you . 
 [ shifting uncomfortably and sweating ] shhh hot , why didn ' t you get an air - condition - - - should have gotten an air - conditioner for yourself . 
yeah , i am . i am . 
i tried , i tried . i tried to talk to toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil . . . snail . i feel like i ' m dying inside . i feel like neve campbell in sream ii . she thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then , the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends . i learned a lot of lessons from that movie , this is just one of them . 
okay , just summarize . 
that ' s it , that ' s it , perfect . we will get him to hit on somebody , and then we will catch him in the act . 
mm . me too . okay , let ' s get this started . 
what are you doing ? 
for what ? 
no , no , no . 
you ' re the bait for toby ? 
no , for one thing , he ' s not gay . and if somebody were to be bait it would be jim . or ryan . or me . 
yes , sure they do , dwight . 
pamtown lady sing this song , doo - dah doo - dah . hello , pam . jim may i have a moment with pam please . 
oh , oooh his mistress . no . i ' m kidding . no one would ever cheat on you ; you are the complete package , pam . 
okay , what i would like you to do is take this folded note , and deliver it to toby flenderson ? i just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits . do not read it beforehand . can you do that for me ? 
good . [ pam stands up and starts reading note ] n - no no no , don ' t . 
pam . pam , you gave me your word . 
um , i got some photos from costa rica if you want to see them ?

so . . . we all agree to get new chairs then . good ? 
okay . okay , good suggestions . all good suggestions . uh , let ' s just decide and agree upon one . 
alright , so , teams forming . 
you are the silent killer . go back to the annex . 
yes .

wow , okay . well . . . i swallowed all your ideas , i ' m going to digest them and see what comes out the other end .

oh . . . ah , i almost choked . 
hank , thank god you ' re here . the office is at a crossroads . 
yes . i need your sage advice . and everyone , whatever hank decides , that is the decision . that will resolve this issue . [ hank takes some jellybeans from pam ' s jar ] yeah , take as many as you want . 
yes . 
okay . well , we have a surplus . imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand - 
oh , okay . good . good . well , here ' s the thing . some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier . other people are complaining about the chairs . 
it is , yes . 
what ? 
okay . 
oh , there we go . 
now everyone , bear in mind once again that whatever hank says goes . he is an impartial third party . 
so , the copier . 
all right , yes . 
well , what should i do ? 
all right , get out . get out . 
hey david - [ begins coughing violently ] i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry . i ' m eating tiramisu . some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat . i ' m stopping now . 
no , no , no , no , no . no . i ' m calling - [ coughs again ] i ' m sorry . 
mm . i ' m calling because , um , we have a stupid budget surplus , and people - everybody wants something different . 
no , no , no . i want you to make the decision so i ' m not the bad guy . 
the what now ? 
 . . . like a tip ? [ calculates amount ] $ 645 ? ! 
i hate disappointing just one person . and i really hate disappointing everyone . but i love burlington coat factory . you go in there with $ 645 , you are literally a king . 
all right , attention everyone . 
i have made my decision . we do not need a new copier . we do not need new chairs . this copier . . . is . . . [ puts paper on glass and makes a copy , then takes paper from glass ] working perfectly . 
pam , would you stand up for a sec ? [ sits in pam ' s chair ] hmm . see how relaxed i am ? i like this chair . [ slowly sinking into the chair ] offers good support , it is urkelnomically correct . . . it ' s a good chair . i think we ' re spoiled because we don ' t appreciate the things that we have . you think kids in africa have chairs ? no . they sit in big piles of garbage . you think they have copiers ? [ the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where michael is not visible over the desk ] they don ' t have copiers . they don ' t even - [ struggles to get up from pam ' s chair ] gah ! they don ' t even have paper . and we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it . my point i this : i have seen the light in terms of what we need , and it is nothing . 
do i know what ? 
mm , no . . . 
 $ 645 . 
right . 
because that is how my mind works . 
let ' s see . . . 
i don ' t need $ 645 ; i already have $ 645 , more or less . 
this is so stupid . 
this is so , so stupid . and , god . . . [ looks at his watch ] that ' s my phone . 
to be continued ! 
no , i don ' t - this doesn ' t change anything . i have a very important decision to make . we need a new copier . we need new chairs . and i need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me . 
 [ groans in frustration ] you think it ' s easy ? 
okay , you know what ? why don ' t you guys deal with it ? i am going to get up , and i am going to be out in the common area . but you need to decide ; otherwise i ' m taking the bonus . all right ? 
it is a classic management tactic . you have two sides , a deadline , you know that neither of them are gonna concede . what you do is you put ' em in a room , and you just - [ pam and oscar come to the door of kitchen ] hey . 
what ? 
good work . i ' m proud of you . [ pam and oscar leave ] mother - 
 [ wearing a fur coat ] what did we learn this week ? well , one , thanks to me , my team is much , much faster at coming to decisions than i thought they would be . number two , never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it . and three , [ camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat ] you should know that some people think it ' s cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of burlington coat factory . 
hey , phyllis , do i need this invite to get in to the party ? 
awesome . i think this is going to be the best christmas party ever . 
oh , hey , is that princess unicorn ? i thought they were all sold out . 
cool . [ sings ] my horn can pierce the sky . 
this is equal parts scotch , absinthe , rum , gin , vermouth , triple sec , and two packs of splenda . call it a one of everything . 
alright . . . one more time around the block . 
jim , jim . . . . 
that is vodka and i mixed it with orange juice . i call it an orange - vod - juice . . . ka . 
yeah . 
i know . 
 [ sighs ] oh , so this is what every day would be like if you hadn ' t left india . 
can not do it then . monthly dental appointment , soft teeth 
no , no . i celebrate privately . 
why don ' t we just do it now ? we ' ll do it quickly . 
we ' ll do it quickly . 
 [ mimicking ] what if we can ' t do it quickly ? what if we cant do it - - 
hey , shut up . here we go . everybody gather up . 
an intervention . it ' s sort of hard to describe , but really its - - it ' s a coming together . . . it ' s a surprise party for people who are - - who have addictions . and you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves . and then they stop . 
okay , how do you feel ? 
uck . . . t . m . i . 
okay , you know what i thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party . 
i am not asking her to stop drinking . i am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic . 
yeah , obviously you are . okay , everybody who thinks that meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand . [ everyone raises their hand ] 
the aye ' s have it . 
alright , well , let ' s look at this a little bit closer then shall we ? [ pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket ] 
meredith , have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind ? 
do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday ? 
have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the mormon church ? 
i got it on a website , that ' s not important . 
okay , you know what toby ? one of my employees is undergoing a crisis and i wish for just once you would take my side on this . i ' m doing your job man . hey , are you texting ? 
alcohol is a drag . yes . here ' s what i ' d like to do . i ' d like to go around the room and have us each express to meredith how her alcoholism has affected us . i ' ll begin . this christmas party is perhaps the best christmas party i have ever been to , but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this . that ' s how your drinking affected me . anybody else ? another time when meredith ' s drinking affected you ? come on people . if we don ' t say anything she ' s not going to get any better . [ kevin raises his hand ] yes , kevin . 
that ' s - - you didn ' t - - you weren ' t hurt by that . 
okay , no , that ' s not what we ' re going for . who has a problem with meredith ' s drinking ? it has to bother you . it bothers me . right ? how does it bother you ? dwight , don ' t you have anything ? 
who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke ? who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night ? 
was john belushi fine ? was bob hope fine ? hey - - come here . if anything ever happened to you , i would be very angry at myself for not doing all that i could do . 
i want you to say i ' m an alcoholic . 
you can say it as loudly as you want , but we ' re not going to believe you . 
 [ amid groans from the rest of the office ] alright , no , no , no . no . that is the image , i think we can all agree is very disgusting . but you know what , meredith , you lit your hair on fire today . what about tomorrow . ? what is going to happen when you come into work and you ' re dead ? 
everyone in this room loves you , but mark my words , we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore . the next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out . 
dwight - - 
 [ sighs ] . . . okay . 
enabler ! enabler , enabler , enabler , enabler , enabler . it ' s christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help . 
you know what the only thing i want for christmas ? i want meredith to get better . that ' s my only wish . but you know what ? my wishes never come true , so i ' m not going to wish that on her . i - - a watch would be nice . 
 [ whispers to meredith ] i ' ll be down in a minute . [ walks over to toby ] could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned ? 
we did ? 
oh , shoot . oh well , we ' ll have to go someplace else then i guess . 
we could go there , sure . 
yes , yes . 
i have a new place . 
it - - yep , recently . 
all right . 
yeah , oh there you go . 
that ' s good . 
we ' re party girls . 
it ' s okay . it ' s all right . 
meredith , we are doing this for your own good . okay . come on - - 
here we go . this is gonna be good . 
yes you are . [ tries to pull meredith from the car ] 
shhh . . . just calm down . 
 [ chasing meredith ] come on . shh . . . 
here ' s the door . here ' s the door . 
 [ dragging meredith on the floor into the rehab center ] let ' s start meeting - - hello . how are you ? 
i have a deposit . alcoholic . 
so do i sign ? 
as it turns out you can ' t just check someone into rehab against their will . they have to do it voluntarily . they have to hit rock bottom . so i think i know what i need to do at this point . i need to find ways to push meredith to the bottom . um . . . i think i can do it . i did it with jan . 
 [ heard yelling from the street ] yeah ! yeah ! yeah , okay ! twelve miles an hour . eat that , carl lewis ! 
no . no , no . there was wind . 
dwight , there was wind . i want a do - over . 
i want another try . here we go ! [ michael runs past the radar as a car passes ] thirty - one ! thirty - one ! 
i was ahead of the car . thirty - one is my new number . 
go , oscar . thirty - one ' s my number . 
beat it ! 
today ' s a big day . my presence has been requested by [ in an authoritative voice ] chief financial officer , david wallace . [ in normal voice ] he says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff . and , i ' ll be honest , i have little or no idea what that means , so . . . probably bad . 
wait , you still don ' t know . . . 
you still don ' t know . 
 [ to jim ] what are you doing ? 
andy . 
 [ from inside his office ] no , what i ' m saying is . . . 
no , that ' s not it . 
 [ sighs ] how can he still not know ? 
i can ' t take it anymore . 
i am telling andy . 
who should it come from , then ? 
 [ to dwight ] are you still having intercourse with her ? [ dwight ' s expression implies ' yes ' ] 
did you ever have intercourse in this office ? [ dwight ' s expression implies ' yes ' ] 
well ? 
you know this can ' t go on . 
we have to put an end to this . 
come on . [ dwight and jim follow into michael ' s office ] 
when will she be ready ? 
is she crazy in bed ? 
how so , specifically ? 
really ? 
it ' s too late . 
i am already walking . 
okay , what does that mean ? 
 [ sighs ] jim , this has to get out , so we can all deal with it . 
thanks . [ to andy ] andy ? 
walk with me . 
ohh , i do not have much time . . . car ' s all the way over there , to tell you what i have to tell you . and just bear in mind when i say . . . say these things , that . . . are bad things . . . that you hear . . . in your ears . . . this is something that i , if i were you , that i wouldn ' t want to hear . . . 
well . . . no , i ' m not . so i . . . i ' m not very articulate today , so i ' ll just leave it for another time . another day . 
which will be fine . i am off ! 
thank you ! [ gets into his car ] 
 [ through the car window ] okay . i will . . . dwight and angela are having an affair , so . . . 
 [ rolls down car window ] dwight and angela are having an affair . they ' ve been sleeping together for some time . that was the news . i wanted to let you know . 
all right . see you later . [ backs out of the parking space ] ahh . 
yep . [ drives off ] 
right what ? 
david , here it is . my philosophy is basically this . and this is something that i live by . and i always have . and i always will . don ' t ever , for any reason , do anything to anyone , for any reason , ever , no matter what . no matter . . . where . or who , or who you are with , or , or where you are going , or . . . or where you ' ve been . . . ever . for any reason , whatsoever . 
sometimes i ' ll start a sentence , and i don ' t even know where it ' s going . i just hope i find it along the way . like an improv conversation . an improversation . 
this is going to sound sort of high - maintenance , but could we have it , like , three degrees cooler in here ? i always think better when it ' s cooler . 
 [ pokes his head in ] hey , what say we order up some pasta ? 
so i was in the office , and i look over to our accounting division , and there is kevin malone . kevin is wearing a jacket that i ' ve never seen before . and i call over to kevin , " kevin , is that a tweed jacket ? " and he looks at me and he says , " michael , yes it is a tweed jacket . " and i look back at him and i say , " i feel the need ! . . . the need for tweed . " 
 [ rises ] oh , thank you . 
i have to say , i am so impressed with the potential you see in me . 
okay . [ sits back down to continue eating ] 
wow , what a day ! haha ! i thought i was gong to get chewed out , but , hold on ! here ' s an attaboy for ya ! what ? rollercoaster ride ! rollercoaster ! it just goes to show , you leave scranton , exciting things can happen . [ sighs ] ahh ! 
what you talking bout , wallace ? [ imitating what you talking bout willis ] 
hi , i am well , how are you ? 
oh , have you not ? 
yeah . 
okay . 
fax , why don ' t you just send it over on a dinosaur ? 
oh , well , then , email it to me . 
i will seduce her . 
no , i will seduce her . 
no , i got it . 
yeah , so what if i did ? that would take precedence and i would expect your support . 
alright , i am a local business owner . [ dwight nods along ] i need to buy paper . i find out everything about their prices and policies 
michael scarn . 
okay . 
 [ interrupting ] no . 
no , no , i never said denny ' s . ihop . 
oh , don ' t start , 
you know what ? i don ' t want to get into this debate again . i enjoy ihop . 
you will have pancakes and you ' ll like it . 
so what ? 
maybe they are shrinking . 
they could be shrinking . 
ah ha [ popping something in his mouth ] yup . 
mm hmm . 
and there are clouds . there are clouds in the sky , which means gonna rain , bad for business . 
argh , why are you all . . . 
shut up . 
ready to do this ? 
good . here come the sharks . [ they imitate jaws theme sounds and dwight makes shark fin on his forehead ] 
in nature , there is something called a food chain ; it ' s where the shark eats a little shark . and the little shark eats a littler shark . and so on and so on . until you get down to the single cell shark . so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business . 
hello . 
my name is michael scarn . i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company . 
thank you . 
we are a law firm . 
you know , i will be honest with you . . . about something . where we used to live , our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and i just didn ' t feel like a priority . so i guess my question [ reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it ] for you would be [ reading off sheet ] how many clients do you have ? 
really ? that many ? this doesn ' t seem like a very big operation . 
ah , so when did you set up shop ? 
oh vietnam , i hear it ' s lovely . 
so , even specialty paper , say 94 brightness double - bonded , you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock ? 
well that is . . . because . . . i am a genius . 
yes , well about some things , and other things i am very stupid . like , watch this . is this the cup ? [ picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion ] is this the cup ? [ picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion ] is this what i drink out of ? [ glug noise , both laugh ] laughter is my job , tears are my game , law is my profession . 
try 80 . 
hey , hey , how is your interview going ? 
don ' t blow it . hey linda , can i get a picture of you ? 
i would , could you just stand over here ? that would be great [ positioning her towards sign of prince family paper customers ] just a little something to remember the trip by . a little to your left [ positions linda to get better picture ] 
what ' s going on ? little homework over here ? lets see if i can help . huh , math , that ' s not so hard . ok . there are 4 of these , ignore the parenthesis , right ? 
why is this little 2 so small ? it ' s , it ' s weird , you don ' t , you just go by the x . the x means times . 4 times x 2 . what is double 4 ? 
excellent ! way to go ! nice ! [ michael and granddaughter prince exchange high fives ] 
oh , well thank you very much for all of your help . it ' s going to be an incredibly hard decision . 
i . . . okay , okay , okay , [ in disbelief ] alright , thank you . [ heads towards dwight , makes make out lips signal ] 
of course . thank you very much . thanks for your time . 
i cannot wait to contact your clients . 
haha , we struck the mother load ! 
wallace is going to freak . 
he ' s going to absolutely freak . 
oh shoot . 
oh god , what was that ? 
aw , it ' s alright . 
aw , my car . 
no no , we are fine . you have done enough already . 
just , shut up . you know we are just going to call a tow truck , so . . . 
no , no , really not necessary . 
you know let me give you some money for this . 
oh coffee , that ' s too much . [ dwight drinks it ] 
thank you . 
ok , goodbye prince family . 
dwight , what will happen to that family if i call david and give him this information ? 
ok . you know , our sales are fine . we ' re doing fine . they ' re doing fine . 
why don ' t we just , live and let live ? 
live and let live . 
it ' s from james bond . 
i ' m not going to make this call . 
my heart says . . . 
that is true . 
that is true . we have gone down the wrong path many many times . 
jan . . . ryan . 
you ' re right . 
you are right . i will call david and give him the customer list and i will give him all my info . 
just something i have to do first . 
somewhere safe , where it can ' t hurt anyone [ starts running , dwight follows ] 
oh shoot ! [ gets to his car turns around ] 
those people will be ruined . [ runs out back door ] 
give it , give it . we can ' t do this to those people . 
im not a shark . 
 [ pained ] mpfh . 
thank you . 
okay , bye bye . 
i guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment . it is bitter because i slightly destroyed a wonderful little family . but sweet because david wallace thought i did a good job . that ' s what i hate bittersweet chocolate . i don ' t even . . . what ' s the point of that ? why not just sweet ? who are you helping ? 
oh , hey what is this ? 
oh , she is hot . [ " hillary swank is hot " supporters cheer ] 
oh my god ! okay , it happening . everybody stay calm . 
stay [ bleep ] calm ! 
everyone , now [ bleep ] calm down ! 
what does warm mean ? 
don ' t run . 
get out of the way ! go , go , go ! 
okay , we ' re trapped . everyone for himself . 
 [ throws the projector out the window ] help ! ! help ! ! 
no , no , no ! you will not die ! stanley ! stanley ! you will not die ! stanley ! stanley ! barack is president ! you are black , stanley ! i ' m gonna give him mouth to mouth . 
he ' s going to swallow is tongue . 
open your mouth . come on . don ' t swallow it . 
leave me al - - 
saving him ! 
electricity . 
hed . hedded 
take hedded of . 
heed . heed . 
take heed of . 
take heed of . 
okay . [ walks to the window , sighs ] this city . dwight . we are not mad , we are just disappointed . 
yes . we are . we are livid . but we are going to let this one slide . 
i am not a mind reader , david . 
can you shove down ? instead . . . shove down , please . instead , what i think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer . 
and we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice . something that dwight doesn ' t like . 
do you ? 
you talking to me ? 
what ? 
 [ sighs ] no , dwight . i am worried . a man ' s life is in my hands . 
yeah . 
that ' s not gonna happen . i ' m taking over as safety man . 
yes . 
i ' m a smart guy . i ' ll figure it out . 
no , i will . 
nobody should have to go to work thinking , " oh , this is the place that i might die today . " that ' s what a hospital is for . an office is for not dying . an office is a place to live life to the fullest , to the max , to . . . an office is a place where dreams come true . 
shhh ! don ' t excite him . don ' t make him excitable . [ whispering ] welcome back , stanley . 
andy . 
no , no , no . no debate . you are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet . 
okay , you know what ? that could be a little confusing , because in sales a - b - c means " always be closing . " 
shut it . shut it . 
we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his . . . when his heart went berserk . and i knew exactly what to do , but in a much more real sense i had no idea what to do . so i thought we should have cpr training class and of course you can ' t get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it . red cross , you know , racket . 
you know who i really think should go ? stanley . 
come on . 
no rest for the sick . we are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working . what are you gonna do if you ' re by yourself and your heart stops ? 
and you ' re okay with that ? 
uh - uh . no , no , no . come on . get up . let ' s do this . 
come on stanley . you ' re losing you . you ' re losing you . do it ! 
this is you we ' re talking about . 
okay , okay . i ' ll show them . here we go . [ whispers ] stanley . all right . 
no , rose . they are not breathing . and they have no arms or legs . 
where are they ? you know what ? if we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them ? i mean , what kind of quality of life do we have there ? 
how about no arms ? no arms or legs is basically how you exist right now , kevin . you don ' t do anything . 
okay , that ' s uh , hard to keep track . how many is that per hour ? 
i will divide and then count to it . 
yes , yes i do . i love that song . [ clears throat , begins to sing ] first i was afraid , i was petrified . 
okay , i got it . 
ah , ah , ah , ah , stayin ' alive , stayin ' alive [ andy joins in ] ah , ah , ah , ah , stayin ' alive , stayin ' alive . 
ah , ah , ah , ah . . . 
he is an organ donor . 
yeah . 
hey , stanley . 
are you okay ? 
five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy ? 
okay , look . david , this is why we have training . we start with the dummy , and we learn from our mistakes . and now dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person . 
hi , everyone . corporate has given dwight two strikes . they are very , very upset with him . so , as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology . dwight , have you prepared your statement of regret ? 
let ' s hear it . 
 [ in a monk - impression tone ] ohmmm . . . ohmmm . . . everybody sit on the floor indian style like me . [ meredtih sits indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of michael ] ohmmm my god if you ' re wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm . . . ohmmm . . . 
my goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for stanley hudson as i can . i think sounds have a lot to do with that . here are some downloaded peaceful sounds . [ a couple of sounds play on the computer ] that one makes me think . . . of death . it ' s kinda nice . . . 
 [ everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off , michael is walking around with a candle in his hand ] it is a beautiful , sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful . now , up ahead , a castle , in a distance . 
and you walk up toward the castle , and inside the castle are 4 men , and each of them , none of them have shoes , and they give you a funny cigarette , and you feel even more relaxed , and then you want ice cream . you want a big bowl of ice cream . what kind do you want ? shout it out . 
too expensive . 
racism is dead stanley , you can have any kind of ice cream you want . what do you want ? [ beeping starts ] what is that ? people ! please i told you to get rid of the cell phones . 
oh , ok . what is that , like , a video game ? 
you have stress ? 
during our relaxation exercise ? 
no no , i ' ll help you . i ' ll help you up . here we go . 
let me getcha . 
ok , alright . 
ok . [ beeping slows down ] 
ok . . . i think that thing is on the fritz . ahh . . . oscar , would you reach over and touch his thing ? that ' s what he said ! right guys , ' cause of gay ? [ oscar has stanley ' s monitor now ] let ' s give this a shot . 
hellloo . . . [ beeping speeds up as michael gets closer ] 
so . . . it wasn ' t dwight after all . looks like i am the killer . you never expect that you ' re the killer . . . it ' s uh . . . great twist . great twist . 
i don ' t get it . do i stress you out ? 
oh . . . 
remember when people used to say boss , when they were describing something that was really cool like , those shoulder pads are really boss man . . . look at that perm , that perm is so boss . it ' s what made me want to become a boss . and i looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads . but now , boss is just slang for jerk in charge . 
ok everybody , i ' ve figured it out . the reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think . [ jim shakes his head at the camera ] you are keeping these feelings inside , and that is what ' s causing stress . so , what is the solution ? solution is honesty , laughter , and comedy . in short . . . 
what ? no . no , i am talking about a roast ! of michael scott ! oh c ' mon ! who here has the comedy central roast channel ? you ' ve seen it right ? everybody gets together , and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy , and everybody ' s laughing , and everybody ' s hugging each other . . . 
si senor . 
it ' s not ! it ' s not offensive during a roast ! anything goes ! i want you guys to really get crackin on this . i want you to take me down . don ' t hold back . i want you to really make fun of anything about me . it could be my race , could be the fact that i ' m so fit , or i ' m a womanizer . . . fair game . whatever . i don ' t want to write your stuff for you , but i just want it to be good . 
i can already feel people ' s stress starting to melt . i think they ' re very excited about paying their respects this way . i have got to make sure that youtube comes down to tape this . 
whoo ! ! welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome . you are all jerks . just kidding , not yet anyway . welcome to the roast of mr . michael scott . if you ' re here for the grabowski wedding , it is the second door on the left . [ creed looks around ] so , we all know how these work , needs to get crazy , take your best shot . i am going to sit right here on my chair and . . . ah . . . whoever wants to come up and roast me , you may . [ angela jumps up ] ok . . . lower the mic for the midget . 
hey hey , i don ' t go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers . ha ha !

pow pow pow . . . [ hands making gunshot impression , sporadic clapping ]

idiot . idiot ! idiot . idiot .

hey , ya know what ? forgive me for caring . right ? 
can i make just a little announcement . in a professional roast , usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they ' re done , something about how much they love them , so , just , keep that in mind . 
we are , we are a family . 
oh very funny . 
uhh . . . hehe hah ! i ' m thinking roy ? 
i don ' t believe i have had the pleasure . 
jefferson . 
haha ha . thank you very much , thank you . that was great . great job , great laughs . really , really went after my intelligence there . [ clears throat ] dozens of online iq test might prove you wrong , but , and my thing isn ' t tiny , its average , so . . . get your facts straight . [ clears throat again ] so when i heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor , i thought [ choking up , clears throat again ] sorry . [ laughs nervously ] i think i have a frog in my throat . um . . . [ sigh ] i decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people , um , first up phyllis and kevin . uh um . . . [ michael walks off stage , knocking over the snare drum ] 
 [ at a park throwing whole pieces of bread ] caw . . . caw . . . caw caw . . . caw . . . 
you know sometimes , to get perspective , i like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away . and , our problems don ' t matter to him , because we ' re just a distant point of light . but he feels sorry for me , because he has an incredibly powerful microscope , and he can see my face . [ looks towards the sky ] i ' m okay . no , i ' m not . 
i um , i spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons , i guess they all flew west for the winter , and i , i just had some thoughts that i wanted to share with you people . 
well i wrote them down so i wouldn ' t forget . jim , you ' re 6 ' 11 and you weigh 90 pounds , gumby has a better body than you . boom . roasted . dwight , you ' re a kiss ass . boom . roasted . pam , you failed art school . boom . roasted . meredith , you ' ve slept with so many guys you ' re starting to look like one . boom . roasted . kevin , i can ' t decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke . boom . roasted . creed , you ' re teeth called , your breath stinks . boom . roasted . angela where ' s angela ? [ angela raises her hand ] whoa there you are , i didn ' t see you there behind that grain of rice . boom . roasted . stanley , you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks . boom . roasted . oscar , you are . . .

[ stanley is still laughing ] alright . alright everybody , you know i kid , you know i kid . you guys are the reason i went into the paper business , so , uh , goodnight , god bless , god bless america , and get home safe . [ clapping and murmurs of appreciation ] 
they say that laughter is the best medicine so stanley , you can throw away those pills . you are cured . actually , you should . . . better hold onto them pills , just in case . 
 [ breathing heavy over intercom , starts laughing ] 
 [ over pa ] this is your captain speaking , the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories . look out your left hand window and you will see vance refrigeration . [ snickering ] i am the ghost of salesman past , do not come near me . [ wheezing laughing , starts coughing ] yes michael scott for dr . jocelyn , please . hello doctor i was just following up on my mole again . no , i was looking online about sebaceous cysts . i have not been squeezing it . 
could i stick it with a pin ? 
 [ still talking over pa ] toby flenderson to the principal ' s office . your mother called , and it appears that you wet the bed again . so you have to get home to wash your sheets [ jim stands up , puts scissors in back pocket ] because they are yellow and they ' re wet with your urine . 
you , and at six foot six , from the university of north carolina , jiiiiim halpeeeeert .

 [ knocks on pam ' s hotel door ] hello , good morning .

well , pam and i have eloped . actually we just robbed a bank , and we are on the lam . [ laughs ] no , uh , seriously , i am on a lecture circuit . apparently scranton has the best sales of any regional branch . so david wallace has asked me to go to all the branches , except nashua , still a little bit raw there . um , but i am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success . my 11 business herbs and spices , in a sales batter . [ looks at pam ] oh that , well , that is pam . pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so i can focus . and i like to pack heavy . 
no ! that is a toboggan , you never know when you ' re gonna find a snowy hill so . . . every magician has a hot assistant , and every rock star has a roadie , and pam is my hot roadie . 
yeah , oh don ' t say bucks , it ' s not lady like . here we go ! [ gets in backseat ] okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night . 
well that goes without saying . 
hey ! look at what you ' re wearing again , pam . have you ever seen a magician ' s assistant ? that ' s . . . 
 . . . kind of [ retches ] maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something . 
no . oh , all right . 
no . i need silence or sam kinison to prepare . 
then listen to your ipod , pam . 
well then . . . hey you know what then let ' s just talk . 
you nervous about seeing karen again , since she was the other woman ? actually you were the other woman so . . . 
is that why your wearing makeup today ? 
hello , rolando , how are you ? 
rolando , [ clears throat ] i ' d like you to meet pam . she is our receptionist . you know what ? maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime . 
okay , don ' t be nervous , just picture her naked . 
that ' s what i do , steal my trick . 
 [ notices karen ' s pregnant ] oh my god . is that jim ' s ?

 [ on cell phone ] no ! oh , my god . oh , no . that is so awful . that is the worst news . i have to go . i have to do a presentation . i ' ll talk to you . . . [ hangs up phone , sighs ] this is going to be hard for me to speak today . because i just learned that my father has died . . . . no , he didn ' t ! he is alive . and this isn ' t even a cell phone . this is a calculator . but you bought it ! and now you can ' t return it . or can you ? no you can ' t . [ karen raises her hand ] yes . karen , do you need to go pump ? 
i am talking about , how you all need to sell an experience . like i sold you on the idea that my father had died . 
would a liar bring mini mounds bars ? [ pam tosses a handful of mounds bars at everyone ] 
i am a theatrical person . growing up , i always thought i would become an actor . because i have , these memorization tricks that i use . um , for instance , i learned the pledge of allegiance by setting it to the tune of old macdonald . [ starts singing ] i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america , and to the republic for which it stands , one nation under god . with a woof - woof here , and a woof - woof there . here a woof , there a woof . everywhere a woof , woof . um , you get it . 
i don ' t know you . but i need to know you in order to sell to you . that is why i have asked you to go around and tell me you names . i have an amazing mnemonic device , by which i have memorized all of your names . shirty , mole , lazy eye , mexico , baldy , sugar boobs , black woman . i have taken a unique part of who you are , and i have used that to memorize your name . baldy , your head is bald . it is hairless . it is shiny , it is reflective like a mirror . " m " your name is mark . 
got it . it works . 
but it works . i would like you all to give this a shot . what do you say ? 
well , then it will be easier for you . but i , i still think it ' s worthwhile , to give a , give it a try . 
oh , i still have more . 
she is pregnant . she is knocked up . " k " karen . pam , let ' s go . 
i grab this [ grabs a chain saw ] , and i turn it on and i say , " prepare yourself , for the utica chain store massacre . " 
no , don ' t worry , the chain is off . 
email ' s not scary . this is an opportunity . don ' t , don ' t blow it . 
it ' s really amazing . congratulations karen . so is there a guy or , uh , a person . or , uh , a sperm machine that did this to you , or ? 
oh , great . 
no , it ' s really dorky . you were right the first time . 
old hatreds dissolve into new friendships . it ' s a really wonderful moment . 
i would give that lecture a solid b + . although , for the record , karen . wow , kind of mean . 
really ? no , honestly . tell me what you really think . 
why ? 
no . i ' m just thinking about what you said , about karen , about closure . you remember holly ? she used to work for h . r . ? 
blonde hair , nice boobs . not too big , not too small . 
she was the love of my life . what you and jim have times 100 . just she . . . she just left . and i didn ' t . . . i never got closure , you know ? i never got closure with her . i haven ' t talked to her since . i haven ' t seen her since . and i feel like i need to go to nashua and get closure . i feel like i need that . 
 [ scoofs ] i ' ll just blow off the lecture at rochester . 
 [ chuckles ] okay . 
do i look okay ? 
hi . 
yes , you can . i am , uh , michael scott , regional manager of the scranton branch .

i know , just . . . uh , please , i ' m going through something , okay ? [ exhales ] 
and then she ' ll move back to scranton . and her boyfriend will die .

" well , we are going to find out today . show of hands . how many of you are salesmen ? let ' s see the salesmen . [ some raise their hands ] oh , okay . well i know what the rest of you are thinking . wow , yuck . salesmen are the worst ! they are awful . they are so arrogant . they think the whole place revolves around them . handsome , good listeners , funny , mr . wonderful . so , okay , you ' re a salesman . what ' s , uh , what ' s your name ?

i went through holly ' s things . 
i stole a sleeve of her sweater . 
i also stole something off of her computer . a document called " dear michael . "

 [ coming out from his office ] hello , may i help you ? 
 . . . jim .

oh , look at that . cupids and hearts . really shoving our faces in it this year . you doin ok , bud ?

just about everyone in this office is single right now . including me . and everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain . especially me , because of my great capacity for emotion , and it is my first valentine ' s day since holly , so i think that i am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces . 
pam , really , they ' re back ? 
can i have a word with you , jim ? 
yes , um , jim . today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office . 
yeah . and the sexy looks between you and pam , the general sexiness , the flowers , it ' s creating a bit of a hostile work environment . 
mm - hmm . 
well , if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest - - 
 - - that none of us can be a part of - - 
 [ gesturing pam to be quiet ] - - then , we , are gonna have our own private valentine ' s day party . 
so suck it . hey everybody , i just invited jim to suck it , and i am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention , a lonely heart ' s convention , this afternoon . singles only . 
so we may not have someone in our lives that we love , but we do have each other . 
i am about to give blood . the gift of everlasting life , the transfer of my bodily fluids , oh wow , that ' s a big needle , that - - 
okay . hello . 
oh , ok . 
yeah , me too . 
oh , well , that ' s fine . 
yeah , can i point something out to you ? 
you ' re actually talking a lot . 
okay , here we go . 
oh , god . [ michael clears his throat ] 
yup , i ' m good , whew . wow , i feel like a human juicebox . [ blood girl laughs ] hawaiian blood punch . 
type o - ocean spray . 
yick . 
i looked at the bag . 
i looked straight at the bag . 
could you distract me for a second , just talk about things that don ' t have blood in them ? 
that was mean . 
a hat . 
that is full of soup . 
what ? 
oh , already . 
whew , wow i was so nervous about this i don ' t think i ate for three days . [ michael passes out ] 
 [ ccming to ] oh my god , how long was i out ? [ michael looks over where blood girl was and sees hank ] 
excuse me , waitress , where did the lady go ? 
ok . oh , wait a second , wait a second , that ' s hers . this is hers , she left her glove . i need her name if i ' m gonna return her glove . 
well here we all are . alone but together . no flowers for us . [ in a mexican accent ] relationships , we don ' t need no stinking relationships . i think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story , and then get past it , just blow through it , yeah ? kelly , what about ryan ? he treated you pretty terribly , yeah ? 
yeah , but now his heart is in thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex . [ kelly looks hurt ] okay , sorry , let ' s , who else ? oscar . 
come on , i ' m sure there ' s something you need to get off your chest . 
if you wanna just , anything ? are you sure ? i ' m sure whatever you did it wasn ' t your fault . ok well , who else ? 
moron , if he was there wouldn ' t be a story . 
really sad . 
oh my god . 
well then it ' s a happy ending , because he was gay . you should call him ! 
alright who ' s next ? where ' s andy ? 
what ? 
you know what guys ? i don ' t think we need to do this . 
no , no , no , no . i mean have this kind of party . i look around and i see all these beautiful people who are alone on valentine ' s , and i think that there are other single people out there too . we just need to find them . there ' s a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park . there has to be a way to get all these lonely people together . 
no . not a giant net . 
i was thinking maybe like a mixer . 
old fashioned meet market - - 
 - - i don ' t think it is . 
these people need love and i am going to get it for them who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today ? a great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else . i am going to be cupid , and i am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims , and they are going to get hit and say " i ' m in love i was hit by cupid ' s sparrow . " funny little bird , but he gets the job done . 
hey . 
ah , still early . 
 [ sighs ] so how you holding up ? 
no . no , i meant about being single today . 
meh , exactly . eh . 
oh , here we go . 
hello . [ two women , a blonde and a redhead , enter the office . michael and dwight walk towards them and dwight extends his hand to the redhead ] 
babe alert ! [ to the redhead ] hello , i ' m michael scott , welcome to our little shindig . 
lynn , follow me , come on in . for you we have one of our top people kevin malone . kevin , come out here show your beautiful self . 
 [ after a short pause ] so run with the ball ! run with it , kev . [ after another pause ] where you from ? 
yeah , ok . well , he only gets better . 
so , eric . you mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair . 
meredith recently had a total hysterectomy , so that ' s sort of a repair . alright , i ' ll let you guys talk . 
it ' s going very well . people are mixing , a lot of hope . cause that ' s what you hate to see , when hope gets crushed . [ michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door ] sorry , thought i heard somebody coming in . um , so [ looking at his watch ] it ' s not too late . 
no reason . 
nobody ' s after me , i just , i met a woman when i was giving blood and i thought she might come by . 
it ' s not a big deal really , i just , you know met somebody , we hardly talked , i picked up her glove so i was hoping i could give it back to her . 
believe me its nothing . i hardly even talked to her we just , we were lying there next to each other , i think our blood bags touched . 
nah . [ everyone groans and girl turns around and walks away . 
hey , you don ' t deserve her . 
hey , if anybody wants to go . . . 
really ? [ everybody signifies their agreement , and kelly gives michael a piece of cake ] oh , thanks . 
you know what , you guys , you guys can get out i ' m gonna soldier on a little bit . 
 [ after some encouragement ] ok . 
four months ago , i dated a woman named holly and , um , this is actually the first time that i ' ve even considered getting back into that arena again . you know what , sometimes it ' s not about whether cinderella gets her slipper back , but it ' s about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all . there ' s a lot of princesses out there . you know , they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so i think , i think my odds are pretty good . 
pam ? 
pam ? knock , knock . 
i know you are . knock , knock . 
 [ at same time as pam ] 4 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 1 
they would never know it was me doing it . here we go , knock , knock . [ dwight walks over ] 
buddha . 
 [ puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on pam ' s desk ] buddha this bread for me , won ' t you ? [ michael and dwight laugh ] 
i , i need something to wipe my hand . 
that was helping . it was classic . 
no . . . god . 
alright . 
who ' s there ? 
kgb - [ dwight slaps michael on the face ] 
what the hell was that ? [ michael starts to fight with dwight ] 
what are you doing ? 
you , you like that ? 
mine was retribution . what are you doing ? no more knock - knock jokes . that ' s it . 
 [ to jim ] who ' s there ? 
dwight , get the door . 
answer the door . 
i ' m not gonna answer it 
oh , no , no , no , no . i am not michael . i am willy wonkaaaaa . 
why thank you very much . [ notices jelly beans ] oh , what are those ? what are those ? tell me , please ! 
no , no , no . they are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl . these are extraordinary jelly beans ! 
the willy wonka golden ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea i have ever had . it ' s probably the best idea anybody has ever had . three days ago , i slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments . this entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order . it will be a day for them that is full of whimsy , and full of excitement and full of fantasy . 
i ' ve written these things because it is my responsibility , as manager of this branch , to profiligate great ideas and i think i have done my part with the golden ticket promotion . now it is your turn . i want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine . [ jim raises hand ] umm hmm . 
too many words . good ideas are simple . ' golden ticket . ' 
no . jim . we ' re a business . post - its . that is a golden ticket idea . nasa took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon . 
no , you don ' t . no , it - [ sighs ] what will be the state of this company if i am the only one coming up with the great ideas ? right ? 
woo hoo . 
tell me ; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips . . . 
 . . . or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession ? 
invite them on the tour . 
really ? that ' s kind of a big client . [ gets up and heads toward oscar ] hey , oscar . woo hoo hoo . um , how much of a hit is ten percent of our blue cross account ? 
yeah ? 
yeah . 
i thought i did . so . . . 
well no harm no foul . 
you didn ' t , but . . . it ' ll be fine . it ' ll be good . 
hey . hey . hey . you idiot . 
sir . i placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with blue cross . how does this happen ? 
irrelevant . 
ok , i ' m going to ask you something and i want you to be honest . what is a pallet ? 
my golden ticket idea ? ok . why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea ? there is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody ' s golden ticket idea . [ sighs ] that . . . [ sighs ] 
nobody panic . the good news is . . . they can ' t fire all of us , right ? 
no , they can ' t . 
oscar , you don ' t know what the hell you are talking about . 
alright , then we ' re screwed . i am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy , so - 
thank you , jim is with me . 
well you know what jim ? it is not my fault that you bought a house to impress pam . that is why carnations exist . 
ok , we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess . [ pam raises hand ] yes . 
ok , don ' t get that . please ? [ pam gets up to answer her phone ] 
that is not constructive . 
 [ on phone ] hello david . i just got back from my procedure , so - - 
how are you doing ? 
 [ reading from computer ] my colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera . 
well , there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and i just don ' t . . . i don ' t know . 
i think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant . 
you ' re breaking up . 
ok , i think , it might have been an inside consultant . 
yes . 
no . 
 [ long pause ] yes . 
 [ dwight walks in ] come on in . good to see ya , have a seat . i just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea . 
woah , wow , who told you that ? 
 [ same time as dwight ] no , i don ' t think i ever did . that was your idea dwight . 
i ' m not taking . . . i ' m not taking . . . 
wait a second , wait a second , i wrote it down in my diary . 
yes i do . you ' ve just never seen it . [ reading from diary ] march 4th . dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets . 
why do you have a diary ? 
ok , you know what ? you came up with this idea . i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up . 
yes , you did . 
what are you writing ? [ dwight writes in diary ] 
would you like to go to lunch with me ? just the two of us ? 
we think a lot alike . sometimes you will think something and i will say what you ' re thinking - - 
umm , nacho chips . 
oh , ok . let me just cut to the chase , dwight . i want you to fall on your sword for me . 
why do you even want to stay at dunder mifflin ? i mean what ' s the point ? you ' re cooped up in there all day . you don ' t get to do your farming . you ' re not dating angela anymore . it doesn ' t matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea . it doesn ' t matter . me on the other hand , i would be lost without this place . you , way too manly . 
 [ sighs ] it ' s not ready yet . 
i have an idea for a fancy men ' s shoe store called shoe la la . and it ' s just men ' s shoes for the special occasions in a man ' s life , like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby , or for just lounging around the house . 
may i have your attention please . i have an announcement . mr . dwight schrute and i just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although i probably will never do it again , i had fun . i really had fun with my best friend , dwight . 
yes they are , you just don ' t care about the information . 
he doesn ' t love it that much . wouldn ' t be such a bad thing for him to be fired . 
i mean , like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion . . . 
right . 
that ' s it . that ' s it . you can ' t put a price on freedom . 
that ' s why you made the decision . that ' s why you made . . . 
you kind of have . 
yes . 
 [ seeing david wallace come into the office ] oh my god . dwight ! dwight ! get in - - - what ' s it gonna be , what are you gonna do ? [ dwight runs into michael ' s office ] what ' s it gonna be ? are you gonna do this thing for me ? dwight ? [ david knocks on michael ' s door and opens door ] hey david , how are you ? good to see you . nice surprise . dwight and i were just having a very unfortunate conversation . 
yes it is , but it had to be done , didn ' t it ? 
hey , dwight , great idea . dwight , dwight , great idea . how ' d you come up with that idea ? 
really ? how did - - how are you inspired ? how did it pop into your head dwight ? 
give me the details of how that happened . 
what ? 
david ? david ? 
david ? 
could i be a part of the meeting also ? 
there is no movie called willy wonka . it ' s called willy wonka and the chocolate factory . 
i can ' t . . . vouch for that . but i do know this . he is a liar . he has taken my idea . 
ok , here ' s what happened , david . it was all my idea . you called me and you were really angry at me and i got scared , so i had dwight take the fall , but now , it turns out that it ' s a great idea and dwight will not confess . can you believe that ? 
oh how dare you . 
you are ? good ideas , huh ? hey , did you come up with toilet buddy ? it ' s a net , circular net , that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet ? formally known as toilet guard ? 
oh please . 
toilet sponge . it ' s a hollowed out sponge . . . 
 . . . that is more absorbent , and softer than toilet paper . i have a lot of toilet ideas . 
they ' re not easy . everybody has to go to the bathroom . 
thank you ! 
well david , i will be honest with you . i do want the credit without any of the blame . 
when they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that i had a good idea . and that ' s what i am going to write down in my diary . that is what i want you to write down in yours . 
i want to see it . 
i want to see it . [ michael gets up to try to see dwight ' s diary ] 
give me . . . give me the diary . 
i like it . 
i think you ' re right . this party has to have all the excitement , drama and intrigue of my time here . 
and classy , yeah . 
 [ watches jim grimace , copies him ] you know , that ' s good but it ' s not classy . i - i need something classy like the opening of a car dealership . 
yes . 
he is . 
that ' s what makes him classy . 
strawberries ? 
not classy at all . 
french . classy . 
 [ on speakerphone ] yes ? 
miner ? i hardly know her ! . . . hello ? 
uh - huh . [ comes out of office ] well , well , well , who have we here ? ah , it is prince charles miner . [ shakes charles ' hand ] at your service . everybody , this is sir charles miner and he is the new vp for the northeast region . so , just give it up for this big guy , right ? give it up . [ leads round of applause ] here he is . 
wow ! hold that thought . i want everybody to go into the break room . i have a little surprise for you . go ahead . you too . dwight , would you escort our guest in there ? c ' mon , here we go , don ' t be shy , don ' t be shy , you ' re one of us . [ whispers ] dwight , stall him a little , i have to get the fish . 
yes . 
what ? no , i didn ' t want to make everybody nervous . 
you look dynamite . what are you talking about ? very slick . ok , get the fish . 
surprise , there is nothing in here . the real surprise is in the conference room . let ' s go ! [ swings arm above head for everyone to come , hits doorframe ] oh ! god ! ok , come on , come on ! 
surprise ! [ unveils bagels sitting on table ] as you can see , i turned the bagels from o ' s into c ' s , for charles . 
took me all night . 
i met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other ' s vibe . i was totally grooving on him and vice - versa . and besides , the last two people to have his job were jan and ryan . the former was my lover , and the latter my best friend . so , who knows ? i do . [ in british cockney accent ] it ' s gonna be mental ! it ' s going to be mental . 
all right , let me introduce you to some of the troops . accounting , front and center . come on up here . i ' d like you to meet somebody . this is the accounting department . 
oh , nerd alert ! 
this is oscar martinez . he is latino . and he just got out of a long - term relationship with a man , gil , who broke his heart . but he didn ' t bring any of that into work , it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and i am very proud of him for that . 
this little hell - raiser is angela . she has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office . one over there , in the orange [ points to andy ] 
there you go ! where ' s the other ? 
well , perfect , because we have now arrived at kevin and he has no sexual history . 
good . good , good , good . everyone , please give it up for charles miner . [ claps ] 
oh ! well . . . 
above and beyond . 
that ' s true . 
no . absolutely not . 
well , due to the economy , there is a lot of worry going around . i didn ' t want to worry people . 
well , why don ' t - 
charles is going to tell you . 
well , it ' s not official . 
such as salary , benefits , etc , etc . insurance . 
well - 
ok , ok , you know what ? i think this has been great . i think this gives us a lot to think about , doesn ' t it ? charles miner , ladies and gentlemen . [ starts round of applause ] he has a long trip home . thank you for coming in . we have to get back to work . 
oh no , no , no . you don ' t have to do that . i ' ve got this covered . this was just a meet - and - greet . 
i am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that i ' m supposed to have . thrilled . 
 [ on speakerphone ] david , it was my understanding that i was not going to be managed . 
it was my understanding . 
listen , why don ' t we just leave that position vacant ? truth be told , i think i thrive under a lack of accountability . 
but the branch is still mine ? 
oh , right . david , are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party ? 
oh , ok . if we hire cirque de soleil as salaried employees , will that help us with year - end tax stuff ? [ several seconds of silence ] 
i just got off the horn with david wallace , and he said that you and i should try to get to know each other better . and i agree , so what i would like you to do is tell me something that you ' ve never told anybody before . 
come on . what ' s your wife ' s name ? where did you work before you came here ? 
beautiful . see , african - americans have such a rich history of unusual names . 
you ' re not from paper ? 
does david know this ? 
well that , actually , is an excellent segue into really what is my only point - 
and that - i - i don ' t need to be managed , charles . and if you want pick up some tips , observing here , and take them to the other branches , it ' s all good . but jan would mostly come by when she was super horny , and ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry , so . . . are we clear ? 
ok , alright , well i ' ll just bounce that off david , see what comes back . 
whatever david wants . 
 [ on phone ] michael scott calling for david . well , just tell him to call me asap as possible . thanks . 
no ! you idiot ! [ hangs up ] idiot , idiot , idiot ! what are you doing ? god ! oh my god . [ redials ] 
hi stephanie , it ' s michael scott again . i just spoke with michael scotch and the son ' s going to be returned , everything ' s fine . 
and i really really need to talk to david . 
i was never given a name . [ hangs up , he and dwight sigh in relief ] 
are you kidding me with this ? on the day that i bring in breakfast ? 
i wish you had told us sooner , because i was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad . 
nobody thanked me . 
for breakfast . except charles . you say no more parties , and then you spend all of this money on lunch , i think it ' s a little hypercritical . 
 [ on phone ] damn it , stephanie , put me through to him . is that him in the background ? david ? david ! david , pick up the phone ! 
yep . 
do some overtime ? you want to do some overtime this weekend ? you know what , kevin , i applaud your initiative . yes . you may . 
kevin ? this is my branch . you don ' t ask charles . you ask me . i say , approved . 
yes it is ! 
no , it is not . 
ok , so we ' re on the same page , great . 
ok , michael , what are you doing ? 
no , seriously . 
how old are you ? 
five years old ? 
i ' m gonna walk away . 
i ' m kidding around , wow ! relax , everybody , it ' s just a joke . it ' s fine . boy , so touchy . ppc , let ' s continue our morning meeting in the conference room . 
what is that smaller stripper holding ? 
ok . 
party planning committee . not your concern , charles . 
really ? well then how would we come up with great ideas like jim ' s ? go ahead . 
it ' s a great idea . and we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay . 
but it ' s cool , and it ' s - 
whoa . you ' re talking about my anniversary party , so . . . 
yeah , why don ' t you do that ? 
yeah , here we go . ok . 
what ? 
newsflash : i ' ve been here for fifteen years . headline : you have been here one day . end of story . you have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party . end of story . end of story . end of story ! 
ok , no , no , no , no . no . you know what ? i ' m going to new york . and i am going to talk to david wallace . [ gets jacket ] i ' m going to tell him everything . and i ' m sorry to say , you ' re screwed . and , you know what ? you are gonna be through . and i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry to do that to you . do you even know how paper is made ? it ' s not like steel . you don ' t put it into a furnace . if you put paper into a furnace , you know what would happen ? you ' d ruin it . [ pushes chair as he leaves ] 
hello , stephanie . ok , where is he ? [ looks into empty office ] 
 [ points to bathroom door ] so is this the meeting you ' ve been in all day ? 
i drove . 
cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party . just pulled the rug out from under me . and he said no figs . i ' ve already bought em . and i don ' t have a place to store them . so , i feel like i ' ve been sort of boned . 
do you talk to him about this ? you ' ve talked to him all day , obviously . did you talk to him about this ? 
ok . then i don ' t get it . it doesn ' t make any sense to me . because i thought in the new system i was supposed to talk to charles , and then charles was supposed to talk to you , and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again . 
clearly that ' s what you wanted . 
fifteen years i have been here . and i have sacrificed a lot . 
i ' ve put having a family on hold . 
and i ' ve never gone hang - gliding . and i ' ve never driven my car to the top of mount washington . 
i don ' t understand that after fifteen years of service here , i have to get in the car and drive to new york in order to talk to you . that doesn ' t seem right to me . that doesn ' t seem fair . and i think that i ' ve earned more than that . 
ok . 
 [ gets up to shake david ' s hand ] i quit . 
you have no idea how high i can fly . 
i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit . i got on that ramp and i thought two hours , two hours to go . feeling good . listen to some tunes . should ' ve peed before i left . 
okay , so . i get up to the building , i get to the revolving door . . . broken ! so i have to take the normal door . 
no , no ! i was so nervous it was the wrong building ! i walked into the wrong building ! 
i looked at wallace and i said " i quit ! " and as i turned to leave i looked back and i said " you have no idea how high i can fly . " 
why would i do that ? 
you guys have thought about this a lot more than i have . i just winged it . 
scotch with splenda . tastes like splenda , gets you drunk like scotch . [ in oscar ' s ear ] clinky , clinky - clink . come - on . . . come on , come on . 
 [ slightly drunk ] what am i gonna do ? i ' ll tell ya what i ' m gonna do . i gonna do a little bit of this , a little bit of that . i gonna stay up all day . gonna sleep it up all night . i ' m gonna give it a ohh ! hey ! ho ! and i ' m going to stop worrying about calories . 
i have a job . 
pam , what you don ' t understand is that at my level you just don ' t look in the want - ads for a job . you are head - hunted . 
any good headhunter knows i am available . 
you ' re ' i need you to ' is my command . 
hey . 
you can talk to me for as long as you want . i have all the time in the world . [ eats some spaghetti ] oh god ! blech ! phyllis !

right , i know paper , i know how to manage . i have a name , close your eyes . 
close them . 
alright , michael scott paper company . you want in ? do you want to be a part of this ? 
obviously . 
oh , agreed , mmm , except . . . 
hey hey . . . what ' s up chuck ? 
no i ' m staying . 
pam , listen . this order form . instead of saying " dunder mifflin " at the top is there any way i could get it to say something else ? 
you . . . oh . somebody has been talking in bed . pillow talk . 
this is a dream that i have had since lunch , and i am not giving up on it now . 
before you got here , i ' m the one who landed all these clients . half of them , at least . i can do it again . i know the market , i know the price points . i ' m on it , don ' t worry . so , how do i do that ? 
can ' t i take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape ? 
thank you very much . 
i ' m starting my own paper company .

that ' s what i was thinking , with the farm , so . . . you getting to wherever i ' m gonna put my thing . 
so think about it . lets put a pin in it for now . 
i made it sterile . 
i am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime , oscar . to come work for me .

hmm ? 
okay , i have immunity . it ' s my two - weeks . . . 
hank ? you really think hank is going to be loyal to you ? hank , please escort charles from the building .

oh . wow . " michael scott paper company . " okay . very official . " dear mr . scott . please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence . the penalty , a forfeiture of residence . " 
how are we gonna find an office ? how can we pay for an office ? 
okay . okay . " achey breaky fart . "

hey . i would like a pair of size nine , please . [ ryan is working at the bowling alley ] it ' s michael .

well , it has always been a lifelong dream . 
i ' m . . . 
excuse me . yes ? 
yes , it is . 
yes .

pam . everyone deserves a second second chance . [ walks back to ryan ] ryan , just out of curiosity , how much do you get paid here ?

uh , nine . 
 [ ryan grabs some shoes ] look what he ' s doing . 
he ' s stealing them . okay , okay . 
he ' s already paying for himself . 
right here . 
oh yeah . 
sounds awesome . 
vikram , you ask a lot of questions and i like that . hey , nana ! hi ! 
people turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my nana ' s investment club can help the michael scott paper company become a reality , then i ' m sure that ' s what she would have wanted . does want . 
well i ' m sure that you must all have very , very busy schedules , so i appreciate you meeting with us here today . what this is is a business that i have worked toward my entire life . hey ! [ snaps in front of sleeping old man ] i have assembled what i believe to be the most exciting , sought - after talent in the industry today . ladies and gentlemen , i present to you the dream team . from our very own scranton , pennsylvania - pam beesly . pretty pam is always reaching for the stars and someday , she may just surprise us all and grab one . meet vikram . from his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon , he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry . and do not call it a comeback . the youngest vice president in the history of dunder mifflin , and recent bowling alley employee , ryan howard is about to make a splash in paper . 
okay . i have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry . with a lean , mean fighting crew and low overhead , i think i can perform the same business at a much , much higher rate of profit . 
by wanting it more . by working hard - 
mmmm - my mission is stated as follows : i will not be beat . i will never give up . i am on a mission . that is the michael scott guarantee . 
and i offer same day , free delivery . 
nana . [ softly ] i really think that papa would want you to do this . 
well what is it exactly ? i mean , what , what specifically ? we don ' t - it doesn ' t have to be paper . we could sell medicine and other . . . 
well . . . this might not be the right time , but i need more than i originally asked for . 
okay . 
okay . 
yeah . i have cable and satellite as a backup . [ to pam ] yeah , i know . two not - so - great things in a row . ehhhh , well . stuff happens , right ? at least we got ryan . the rye - guy . we should call him rye bread . we don ' t have to call him that . unless you like it . we could call him that . 
what ' s that ? 
blech . 
well you know what ? my mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world . and that ' s why god made so many . 
well we should make a list . lists are good . lists are good . lists are good . first on the list , let ' s get you out of the car . alright . [ pam tosses list out car window ] okay . . . 
i want you to listen to me . because i want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now , kay ? you quit your job . i quit my job . we both quit . those are the facts . that ' s what happened . now , what are our choices right now ? because you know , kiddo , you quit . 
so what are our options ? well , we can start this paper company . we can try . or . . . that ' s it . that ' s our only option . because we quit . pam , i do my best work when people don ' t believe in me . i remember in high school , my math teacher told me i was gonna flunk out . and know what i did ? the very next day i went out and i scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team . see what i mean ? i thrive on this . i thrive on it . so i ' m gonna go inside . i ' m going to make some calls , i ' m gonna get us an office space , and i ' m going to show you why you joined this company . okay ? [ pam nods ] 
you gotta have some extra space . philly , work with me here . there ' s gotta be some sort of secret office that you have . . . lurkin ' around . . . some awesome , free , keep it off the books . . . oh , no . not there . that would be humiliating . 
i did what i had to do . i stepped in . i took charge . that ' s what being a man is . and earlier today , i was freaking out . pam stepped up . she was the man . don ' t think a woman can be a man ? well , then that ' s your stereotype , not mine . 
 [ walks into room ] okay . 
it ' s right in the middle of the paper belt . 
yeah , i ' m good . you good ? 
you know what they say , keep your friends close . [ pointing to office sign where " dunder mifflin " is listed right above " michael scott pap " ] 
yes , i am , charles . 
except this time , you have no legal right to kick me out , because i have started my very own paper company right here in the building . if i were you , charles miner , i would watch your step . because the michael scott paper company is about to open a big ol ' can of whoopass on dunder mifflin . [ pam and michael stare him down , he walks away ] actually a six pack . we ' re gonna open a six pack of whoopass . he looks scared . 
it ' s britney bitch . and i am back , in the form of a new company . the michael scott paper company . [ tries to parallel park , hits car . ] okay . not gonna make this one . [ drives away revealing plenty of space for the cruiser ] 
hello ! they took away my parking space but they can ' t take away my pride ! [ awkwardly climbs out of his car ] 
i would like to invite you all to come away with me , on a journey . [ nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers , it won ' t cut , he tears it down ] welcome ! to the michael scott paper company ! 
we are in the heart of it . [ bathroom sounds rattle the small office . ] and the surge of water carries our business out to the sea . 
we wait , and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon . 
i don ' t know i think we ' ve done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day . i ' ve updated our contacts , i have gotten quotes from suppliers . i have sent out an e - vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon . six yeses , one maybe , only eleven noes . um , and 788 not yet replieds . but of that group , 782 have viewed it . 
i am going to need 800 of these , on nice bright paper . it is a coupon for unparalleled customer service . [ he sets sheet between pam and ryan on desk . neither takes it . ] 
hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend . 
hey ryan ? [ ryan watches montgomery flea market ad on youtube ] could you get to that copy from before ? 
listen . listen listen listen listen listen listen . i need someone to make a copy of this . because i don ' t make copies , i ' m the boss . got it ? i make originals . 
stop it stop it ! bickering ! stop it ! 
would someone just make the copy ? 
just make that copy okay ? 
they ' re getting on my nerves mom . both of them . r thinks he ' s too good to be here , and p is not as much fun without jim . 
i ' m on the phone , please . mom , i ' m gonna have to call you back . p ' s being a giant b . 
they always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right ! so , i hired my best friends . and this is what i get ? 
listen up . it has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office . and i think i have come up with the reason why . this office space is too small . 
okay . there are . . . 4 corners in this room . each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you . whichever corner you want . and make it your own . 
okay guys , thank you for the offers . but i want you to get pumped about this corner idea . all right ? 1 , 2 , 3 - what are we gonna do ? 
no , you ' re supposed to say , " rock the house . " 
that ' s my corner . 
no , this is where i work . i can ' t relax in the same corner where i work . 
pam , i don ' t make the rules . [ pam walks out . ] 
oh hey ! stanley , phyllis . come on in . welcome , welcome . let me give you the tour . 
thank you . you remember ryan [ stanley laughs deeply ] and pam is around here somewhere . 
what for ? 
yes . 
maybe the michael scott paper company was a huge mistake . i should leave . i should go , and start my own paper company . that ' ll show ' em . 
get your free pancakes . they are delicious . they are nutritious . they are complimentary . [ flips a pancake . it ' s about 8x11 inches ] young sir , would you like a free pancake ? 
ryan , enough with the texting machine . come on . and tuck in your shirt , you ' re the face of this company . 
hey pam . 
you sorta disappeared there for a while . where ya been ? 
yeah ? 
well , at least you ' re still being honest with me . 
these are shaped like paper . 
 [ sits alone at the pancake table , the breeze blowing paper around . ] 
i once had a dream . that i was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich . and , let me tell you something it was delicious . so the next day , i decided to make that sandwich . and in real life it is disgusting . [ the phone rings ] it is a disgusting sandwich . [ it rings again . ] and the reason i tell you this story . [ phone ] pick up the phone . 
don ' t tell them we have free delivery ! [ also whispers ] 
they don ' t know that ! 
give him a guarantee . 
just say the word . 
yes ! 
you did ! 
oh yeah ! 
she did it ! 
yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! [ dancing in the office ] 
who would have thought , that the thing that would save this company would be work ? and pancakes ? in the end , this day definitely had its ups and downs . i realize that we don ' t have the biggest office . which is a surprise , because 165 square feet sounds like a lot . but , we have people with the biggest hearts . and i think for a small company that is really [ flushing ] someone went to the bathroom . that is really what ' s important . 
hup ! [ throws cheese puff to ryan who catches it in his mouth ] 
hup ! [ throws cheese puff to pam who catches it in her mouth ] 
 [ throws a cheese puff over his shoulder to ryan ] 
hey . 
 [ gestures to ' bed & amp ; breakfast ' magazine ] is this good ? 
oh . okay . ed ' s tires , huh ? 
i really appreciate it . 
it ' s for your trouble . 
no , no , listen , as a friend , i want you to have this . 
yes , i do . 
that was four years ago . why don ' t you let it go ? 
ed ' s tires . why don ' t you tell them that we have fewer clients , so we can spend more time with each of them . also , try to discuss it over indian food , and try to mention how you distrust women . 
that is smart . that would not seem genuine . ryan ? 
good , you take the lead on this one . also , do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce . 
bring it in . morning cheer . [ clears throat ] 
 [ on phone ] i need you to get me the prices that you ' re charging ed ' s tires so i can undercut dunder mifflin . 
oh n - is it mose ? did you put the cover on that well ? 
i ' m not following you . 
personal hero , cool new guy . okay , i think i ' m getting your drift . 
crystal clear . so is this for a movie that you ' re writing ? 
can i use it ? [ pam holds up note saying " he ' s talking about you ! " ] 
 [ michael dismisses note , ryan and pam point to notepad ] dwight , are you talking about us ? 
someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now ? 
so i would say that the old boss has always been good to dwight , and he was there first , so he has dibs . you respect dibs , don ' t you ? 
good . will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot ? 
dwight ? 
is the cool new guy charles ? 
is it stanley ? 
hello , dwight . what ' s with the shirt ? are you alright ? 
oh my god ! run ! run ! it ' s a setup . setup ! 
dwight , run ! 
you be cool . 
just - what ' s going on ? 
mm - do . . . dwight would not - 
i . understand . nothing . 
 [ michael storms into office ] wow . 
it was a setup . dwight told charles . he told him . 
it ' s like , a girl says she ' ll make out with you , but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee - filled balloon . 
i got hit in the face with a pee - filled water balloon , pam , ok ? i don ' t know how they did it . they filled the balloon with pee . a funnel ? i don ' t know . is that clear enough for you ? 
hello , traitor . 
i want you to listen to me , friend , and i want you to listen to me good . i am going to come at you , and i am going to come at you hard . i am going to steal all of your clients , and then i am going to kill them in front of you . 
i ' m just getting hardcore with him . 
yes , and hear me , dwight , when i say i brought you into this world , and i can take you out . [ hangs up ] bill cosby . 
 [ on phone ] is mr . schofield there ? 
 [ on phone ] well , if you could do me a big favor and tell mr . schofield that michael scott has tickets to the wilkes - barre penguins game this weekend , and if he would like to join me . . . hello , daniel . how are you ? uh - huh . i sure do . yes . [ referencing rolodex card ] wanted to ask , did kathy ever make jv ? 
wow . high score ? 
hello , dwight , i ' ve been expecting your call . what do you want ? 
so you heard schofield is considering a switch , and you want mercy ? 
no . no . you think i am going to fall for that ? there ' s no - 
meet - ok , go to the spot and then walk 100 feet . 
toward the sun . 
noon . 
you have two seconds . [ dwight starts running ] 
dwight . 
i hope you ' re not recording this conversation . [ dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt ] good . i cannot believe that you sided with charles . 
so you just rat me out ? you could have said no . 
if you want a truce , i will give you a truce . 
i do too . 
cooper ' s . 
damn it . 
 [ michael , ryan and pam sitting at restaurant , phone rings ] oh . dwight - elicious . where you at ? 
really ? that ' s weird . we didn ' t see any . 
what ? 
yeah , sure . 
okay , see you in a bit . dwight hit a bear . he ' ll be here in a sec . 
 [ michael answers phone ] yeah . 
dwight , not now , we ' ve been robbed . 
no , dwight , we were robbed . how would you even know ? you ' re still stuck in traffic . [ pam holds up sign saying " dwight did it ! ! " ] you ? 
what about our truce ? 
on purpose ? 
why ? 
be that as it may , i have your meatball parm sandwich here , and i am going to eat it . 
oh . [ bites into sandwich , looks disgusted ] bastard ! 
dwight , do you mind if we talk ? 
if you keep coming after us , the michael scott paper company cannot succeed . 
oh , one more thing . i ' m going to have you listen while i steal your biggest client . 
oh , uh oh , i ' m turning you down right now . 
you can hear me , but i can ' t hear you . 
oh , great . mr . schofield ' s ready to see me . thank you so much . 
walking in the door . . . 
mr . schofield , good to see you . and i ' m closing the door . [ dwight runs out of the office ] 
 [ on speakerphone in dwight ' s car ] now , when dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year , i think he is speaking out of turn . 
yes . he does not have the authority to say that . i , on the other hand , am the president , the owner , and the founder . it is like you are buying software from bill gates . 
what is that thing that dwight always says ? paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow ? 
that ' s very rude . 
i ' m going to pull a date out of the air right now . april 13th , 2002 . that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs . is it not ? we all know that the economy is bad , and bloated companies like dunder mifflin . . . 
are going to fall by the wayside . two of their branches have closed within the last year . the michael scott paper company , however , has opened a new branch this very month . 
that sounds like a fantastic idea . i will see you this weekend for the penguins . box seats as usual . 
good , good , good . i will see you . 
i color code all my info . i wrote " gay son " in green . green means go , so i know to go ahead and shut up about it . orange means " orange you glad you didn ' t bring it up ? " most colors mean " don ' t say it . " 
i wanted to start a company , not a war . because in a war , you always fight those you are closest to . and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother . for what ? what purpose did that serve ? apart from abolishing slavery ? in that case , war was the right choice . this doesn ' t feel as important though . that ' s just how the world works , i guess . 
 [ answers the phone and talks with mouth full ] 
he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good . and if a friend can ' t make you feel good , then i don ' t want any friends . except dwight , because he is our only source of fertile leads . 
dwight just got howard family dry cleaners . 
he ' s undercutting us big time . he ' s actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket . 
hey , hey , hey . something about that seems inappropriate . 
betrayal ain ' t just a river in egypt . 
it ' s 4 : 30 in the morning . do you know where your kids are ? if you are ryan ' s parents or pam ' s parents or my parents , you do . they ' re gonna be in this van . with me . who am i ? nothing to fear . i am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route . 
 [ honking horn ] time to make the donuts . [ laughs and drives away as ryan tries to get in the van ] come on . whoa ! no , i promise i won ' t do it again . come on . [ does it again ] de - nied ! 
hello ! time to make the donuts ! oh , halpert ! whoa ! boner patrol . arrest that man ! your donuts make me go nuts ! [ laughs ] hey pam . 
milk and sugar . 
that ' s what i said . 
every morning . 
we ' re , uh , we ' re doing okay . a couple weeks in and , um , we ' re having fun . uh , yep . we have 20 - - of those . 
you know what we need ? we need some couches in here . 
oh , you know what you would love ? is if we built a loft . 
like in a dorm room . you put your desk underneath , you have your loft up top . you can sleep up top . 
most do in the magazines . 
we should look into that . or we just go for the loft . 
how much can we afford to pay a delivery guy ? 
they are correct , sir . 
okay . a lame attempt at humor . swing and a miss . 
lowest in town . 
okay , sure . right , so - - why don ' t you explain what that is to - - so that they can under - - just explain what that is . 
explain that . 
well , we don ' t - - 
whatever , yeah . 
our prices are the only thing keeping us in business . 
okay , okay . hold on , hold on . ty , i would like you to crunch those numbers again . 
just crunch ' em . just crunch ' em please . 
hi , jerry . michael scott . well , this is slightly embarrassing . [ laughs ] um , i ' m going to have to . . . ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday . yeah . we did . we got the check , but we ' re just going to need a much , much bigger check . 
did i ever tell you about the day that steve martin died ? 
i know . but i always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life . i was wrong . it ' s this . 
i would love that . 
was it nice ? 
i love pad thai . 
no . there ' s a lot i haven ' t done . 
 [ knocking on door ] hmm ? 
we ' re not hiring , jim . 
listen , i can ' t make you laugh right now . 
jim , what you don ' t understand is that this company ' s worthl - - 
no - - we don ' t have - - 
 [ stammers ] uh . . . yes . 
yes , well , we ' re not only tight - ends , we are also quarterbacks . 
that ' s a pun . 
yep . oh . . . wow . 
of course not . 
nope , nope , nope . 
right , right . there is no way in hell that i am going to say that we ' re broke . 
oh , i ' m really worried that i ' m going to say it . 
ah . . . 
i ' m good , i ' m good . 
it is . i ' m good . 
hello . 
michael scott paper company to see mr . david wallace . i believe we ' re expected . [ david and charles walk out of conference room ] well , well , well . how the turntables . . . 
and we are prepared to reject that offer . 
never accept their first offer . what is your second offer ? 
are you kidding me ? that is insultingly low . i don ' t even want to hear what your first offer was . 
i ' ll see your situation and i ' ll raise you a situation . your company is losing clients left and right . you have a stockholder meeting coming up and you ' re going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding . so they may be looking for a little change in the cfo . so i don ' t think i need to wait out dunder mifflin . i think i just have to wait out you . 
 [ stutters ] we ' ll have to talk - - 
just amongst ourselves . 
oh , my god . oh , my god . 
we are so rich . 
no . 
it ' s a lot of money , okay . but we need money coming in every week . we need jobs . wouldn ' t you rather have a fishing pole than a fish ? 
agreed ? 
shut up , shut up . hello ? 
i want my old job back . i want my old parking space back . i want a sebring . 
and i want charles gone . 
i need him gone . 
okay , then i want pam back . 
sales . 
yes , she is . at the michael scott paper company in it ' s heyday . 
and ryan . 
you know , david . i don ' t care if ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me . 
and dental this time . 
these are our demands . 
our company is worth nothing . that ' s the difference between you and i . business isn ' t about money to me , david . if tomorrow my company goes under , i will just start another paper company . and then another and another and another . i have no shortage of company names . 
that ' s one of ' em ! yes . these are our demands . this is what we want . our balls are in your court . 
can we have the room please ? 
yes ! can you believe it ? that ' s what i ' m talking about ! 
there are certain defining moments in a person ' s life . the day he is born . the day he grows hair . the day he starts a business . and the day he sells that business back to dunder mifflin . what have i learned from all of this ? it is far too early to tell . i just know that i am flying high and i don ' t even want to think about it . i just want to enjoy it . 
no , no . you ' re done . 
someone is returning ! he started his own company , and now he ' s back . who could it be ? i ' ll give you a hint . he is a man . a man you have missed with all your heart . a man who has ruined all other men for you . who is it ? 
 [ whispering ] it ' s michael scott . [ applause ; michael jumps through sign ] hold it up . conference room , five minutes . 
well , i guess the first order of business is to welcome back me , and pam and ryan . [ scattered applause ] and how about casual friday again , huh ? reinstituting casual friday ? you all look great . what i want to do right now is try something a little different . i ' m going to throw it out there , starting with this meeting . i want you guys to run it . i want you to say whatever you want , take it away . your meeting . 
if there is something that you would like to say as a group , then by all means , you may say it to me right now . 
yes . 
take it up with toby . what i want you to do , is i want you to look inward . and i want you to reflect . and i want you to say something different . 
when i needed salespeople for my new paper company , everyone here turned their back on me . am i going to ask them to beg for forgiveness ? no . am i going to ask for big , crying apology ? no . am i going to ask them to slit their wrists for me ? no . i just want a tiny , microscopic version of that . 
oscar , what were you going to say ? 
all right . 
not important . [ everyone mutters ] okay , alright . yes . yes , you have a job . frankly , you have a job because ryan and pam are starting with us as salesmen . 
it ' s going to work very smoothly , because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from michael scott paper company and - - 
no , you lost those clients . 
okay . 
okay , dwight . let me explain something to you . i set the rules and you follow them . blindly . okay ? and if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department . it ' s a trash can . 
 [ hands ryan a soda ] there you are , my friend . 
pamela . 
yep . 
i know . 
i do ? well - - where is that bowl ? 
michael scott paper company only . 
okay , well - - - 
i will - - no , no . i ' ll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom . 
against who ? 
the old michael scott might have taken this , but not the new michael scott . they are in for a bitter surprise . i am not to be truffled with . 
six weeks ago , none of these people wanted to come with me . you two were the only ones with the stones to follow . 
that was us , right there . 
mm - hmm . 
yeah , the commish . 
yeah , yeah . the shield . 
hey gang . where you been ? 
where ' d you eat ? 
what ' d you have , stanley ? 
so since you guys already ate , you won ' t be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch , will you ? [ walks into kitchen ] oh , wow , stanley . is that egg salad ? andy brought some salmon . 
dwight , is that a meat sandwich ? you guys hungry ? 
i ' m going to o have some of this meat sandwich . 
mom . what kind of sauce is on your salmon ? 
mmm . thanks for going out , guys . 
hey , hey guys . you know what i want you to do ? shake hands , get over it . that was not a shake , dwight . 
who quits ? 
you guys gotta be kidding . 
i love it . i love this idea , and i fully support you . as a matter of fact , i ' m going to give you some seed money . [ throws money at phyllis ] there you go . there ' s some seed money for you . and you can take it , no hard feelings . but if you stay , i want an apology , and i want a big one . 
yes i do . 
it ' s frontward ' s . 
no matter how i look at this , i am in the wrong . and i have looked at this thing , like a hundred different ways . from my point of view , from their point of view . . . 98 others . and the bottom line , i am in the wrong . i ' m the bad guy . 
i need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without ryan and pam knowing . 
whatever you guys did earlier . 
just do it , okay ? 
get ' em there . get ' em there . 
are you kidding me ? 
okay , okay , okay . 
so from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart , i am sorry . 
if we could just focus and go down the line , and everyone would say , " apology accepted " , i think we would all feel better . and then we can break out my gift to you - - complimentary white chocolate bark . 
they wouldn ' t make it unless people liked it . 
okay . if i give you your clients back there won ' t be enough clients for ryan and pam , and i promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople . 
fine , have your clients . i can see that ' s what you wanted all along . [ everyone mutters " okay " ] however , i rescind my apology . 
you are not reacting at all as i had hoped . 
jim . can i talk to you for a minute ? 
 [ puts scrabble pieces on board ] and bingo was his name . let ' s go . 
i need your help . this whole pam / ryan debate is screwing with my head . 
you ' re close with pam too . 
pro for ryan , he went to business school , he ' s my number one choice . 
i like his hair . 
okay . 
that sounds pretty biased . 
okay . pam , pros . 
i like her . i think that she is a fast learner . cons , she doesn ' t always follow through . sh - - new york and the whole art school thing . and roy . she has a weird voice . 
i don ' t need to tell you that . 
i don ' t think you are being totally impartial though , because you haven ' t said one bad thing about pam . 
okay . so be it , then you ' ve lost credibility . and i ' m going to go with my guy , and that ' s ryan . 
oh , wow ! whoa ! 
ho - ho , man ! wow . [ in a high - pitched voice ] honey ! i want you to bring the garbage out . ' cause i ' m not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba - - 
i have a very difficult decision to make . it ' s like last week i was at the video store . do i rent devil wears prada again ? or do i finally get around to seeing sophie ' s choice ? it is what you would call a classic difficult decision . 
pam , can you come in here , please ? have a seat . [ clears throat ] well , there ' s no easy way of saying this . so i think i will just . . . drag it out . since the dawn of time there has been - - 
i gave ryan the sales job . there just weren ' t enough clients for the two of you . so i had to - - 
i ' m sorry , sorry . 
 [ laughing ] yes , you did . 
yep . 
no , you - - no . 
no , you ' re the best person for the job . you ' re going to be great . 
 [ laughing ] oh , oh ! 
you should have seen your face . oh man ! oh , that was classic . 
oh , really ? 
oh , man . that was really good . that was really good . 
i don ' t know , i offered him his temp job back . we ' ll see . he was not happy at all when i offered him this job and then i told him he didn ' t get the job , so - - 
i don ' t appreciate you telling me what to do . so clean out your desk , you are through here . 
oh ! what ' s our receptionists name ? 
could you send her in ? 
hello . 
have a seat . 
this is very difficult to say , but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go . [ pick up phone ] hank , could you come up here please ? hank is our security guard - - 
he will be ushering you out . [ starts laughing ] 
oh , your face ! oh ! 
no , i ' m kidding . no , you ' re not - - you ' re not fired . yet . 
oh . . . 
i don ' t know , actually . 
 [ caught by camera crew dancing to " at the car wash " , but laughing ] oh , no . i still have the lease on the michael scott paper company , so occasionally i will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing . i actually dance all the time . tip - toeing around corporate - it is a ballet . when i am breaking all the rules , i am break dancing . and expresso . 
guys , i ' m scared . i ' m really scared . i think i ' m growing into a giant . because look at this normal sized coffee cup . looks so tiny in my giant hand now . anybody want to go to lunch with me later on ? 
okay . how about a woman ? pam ? 
oh , really ? ok . 
what about the rest of you ? [ complete silence ] 
at dunder - mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i don ' t know who instituted it . i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down , but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday . so , rules be damned , i wanna have lunch with these people . 
who else ? who else ? ryan ? 
ok . anyone ? anyone ? at all ? accounting ? i am accounting on you to go to lunch with me . 
what ? 
ugh ! god ! what happened to you people ? [ talking like a robot ] we are just office drones . we are office drones . all we do is work . . . is work . 
 [ still talking like a robot ] i . . . was just learning . . . to . . . love . 
no work . no work . no work . i come in here to release frustration . ooh . ah . ah . ah . ooh . 
that ' s good . 
if you ever want to come down here , door ' s always open , lock ' s broken , so . . . 
come on in . hey , hey , hey . here we go . here we go . yeah . 
now you got it . 
now you got it . hey , you want some espresso ? 
you gotta keep yourself dehydrated . 
ok . i love it . i love it . 
i love it . 
guys , i believe that i have figured out what is up your butts . there ' s no reason to be scared . the bad man is gone . charles is gone . 
charles really did a number on these guys . they are way too focused on work . when i was in charge , this place was like dave and buster ' s people just hanging out , having , fun , eating apps . i don ' t know . it ' s like [ pause ] dave died or something . 
daddy ' s here and daddy is going to take care of you . 
i am your big daddy and i am gonna kiss da boo boo . 
andy ' s afwaid ? 
are you all afwaid ? 
daddy ' s here for you . my wittle angels . ok . i think that i have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk . 
funk is the problem and the solution . 
i ' ve taken my downstairs office and i have turned it into a place to hang out . a place where unattractive and attractive people can get together . to meet . to greet . to see the ones that you love . to love the ones that you see . 
why don ' t you get over lunch , oscar ? everybody else is past it . 
no . dwight is confusing you . that - it ' s , it ' s more of a disco . 
 . . . with coffee but without the haunted . 
it ' s a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building . 
exactly . 
wha - no . no . not even close . i can ' t force you to go down but i can entice you . i ' m gonna be down there . erin will be down there from time to time . . . and all - you - can - eat espresso . 
well , kevin , i guess it is just me and you . 
holdin ' down the fort . 
thank you . 
this is a no work zone . please respect the lei . 
kevin , stay . 
kevin , stay . 
stay , stay . 
cookie . kevin , cookie . 
mmm - hmm . 
come on . 
now i know what the founders of phillip - morris felt like . you just want to give people a smooth , fun way to relax and suddenly you ' re just some terrible monster . 
phyllis ? 
hey ! 
 [ starts dancing with phyllis ] alright . back . there you are . there you go . good . good . ooh . show me some attitude . 
oh , god ! no ! no ! no ! no ! no ! 
oh , wow ! what did you do ? 
you didn ' t do that . you ' re ok . you ' re ok . let ' s lie down . you want to go down ? alright . 
ok . that ' s ok . that ' s not a problem . ok , sweetie . 
no . no . no . 
it ' s her back . we just - we need - let ' s - you know what ? 
we ' re going to take care of you . we ' re gonna get you help . let ' s - come on . 
oh , no . no . no . this is no good . 
i don ' t need you to give me a history lesson . ok ? 
it ' s just , we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor . wait , wait , wait . but most importantly we need to get her some medical attention . asap . stat . 
 [ barging through office door ] alright . here we go . 
you having fun ?

ok , dwight . ok . good . i do not want anyone to worry . 
oh , you know . nohting . she ' s - we were hanging out at cafe disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury . but she ' s a tough , old bird . so . . . 
ok . phyllis did injure herself . but she injured herself having fun and i don ' t think she would trade that memory for anything . [ phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud ] 
you all took a life here today . you did . the life of the party . erin ? 
i want you to go downstairs and i want you to shut it down . 
i don ' t care . bury it . i hope you ' re happy . 
i guess they got what they want . i am eating alone . might as well be dinner .

it ' s better than i imagined it ! 
welcome , welcome ! cafe disco . i am michael scott . 
angela . angela . angela . may i interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance ? 
oh . alright . there you go . 
no . no . no . here is the deal - one signature for every song . 
i know . i know , angela . a lot of people doubted cafe disco at first but it is a magical place . you have to give it a chance . if these walls could tale they would say , " this is a magical place ! you are safe here . we have talking walls . we ' re not going to eat you . " [ angela shows michael the papers again ] no . 
hey , thank you , creed . you ' re really getting this place . 
hey ! hey ! angela , no ! no cleaning up !

my grandpa was the funnest guy i ever knew . he would sing . he would dance . he would . . . . fall down . but then . . . he started going to these meetings and everything changed . he . . . stopped going out at night . he got a job . the fun just dried up . it was really sad . i don ' t want that to happen to you guys . i ' m not gonna let it happen . 
 [ mumbles in his sleep as pam and jim change the clocks in his office ] 
 [ wakes up , joins in with the laughter ] uh oh . what ' s so funny ? 
oh yay ! geography joke . [ still laughing , notices the time ] oh ! wow ! okay . alright , let ' s all go home . come on . see you all tamale .

mmhmm . yeah , that ' s right .

a little bit . uh , i meet a lot of people . 
hey . [ hugs aj a little too forcefully ] arrggh . so would you guys like some lemonade ? or one of you ? or both of you ? either or . the combinations are endless . 
okay . 
you can go to hell . [ laughs ] i ' m kidding . um , sure , i will get you the best iced tea in the world . 
i lied to kevin . holly and i can never be just friends . i wrote down a list of bullet points why holly and i should be together , and i ' m going to find the perfect moment today and i am going to tell her . number one : " holly , you and i are soup snakes . " the - and the reason is . . . because . . . in terms of the soup , we like to - that doesn ' t make any sense . we ' re soul mates . holly and i are soul mates . 
what is up with you two , holly ? 
cool . for who ? 
wow . . . i ' m designing a chair . it ' s part of your pants . you sit down , you ' re supported . 
all right , fatty . i will do it . you know what , we should actually rehearse . 
you bet your fat ass we are . 
well , in his infinite wisdom , david wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of dunder mifflin . 
that ' s right . 
newspapers for sale ! 
i brought some snacky snacks , in case we get hungry . 
 [ watching her eat ] what ? 
um , no , i just thought we ' d wing it . that cool ? 
we could do a movie . . . sort of thing . 
oh ! 
could we get a delorean ? 
oh ! [ to the theme of " jaws " ] dun - der . dun - der . . . 
dun - der . dun - der . dun - der . dun - der . blooo ! ! [ both laugh ] 
no . no . 
we ' re circling it . 
 [ shouts from behind the trees ] uh , it ' s a sketch now . 
and now , presenting . . . 
 [ imitates who wants to be a millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs ] 
yes , i am .

 [ screams ] ahhhh ! ! ohhh ! ! ahhh ! ! i was there ! ahhh ! ! i was a tour guide at dartmouth college ! ! noooo ! ! ! 
yeah , i ' m definitely getting in . i ' m a shoo - in . 
i ' m robert mifflin . [ pause to see audience ' s response ] ah , okay . [ both run back to chairs ] 
two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than i ' ve ever seen in my life . i will say , c , a gun . he shot himself in the head . 
yes ! 
i will say b , buffalo ! final answer ! 
david wallace told me ! ! 
 [ whispers ] i guess not . 
well . . . i didn ' t know they didn ' t know . 
thank you . 
well , he ' s just thinking about his own gifts . 
probably shouldn ' t have mentioned buffalo . 
should ' ve had hindsight . 
i think it went well . i think it was good . 
no , it was a tough audience . 
believe me , i have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time , and that was one of them . 
me too . [ long pause ] we have a lot of good material for next year ' s sketch . 
well you guys should hit the road before . . . i close down another branch . 
good to see you . [ they hug ] aj . 
i didn ' t find a perfect moment , because i think that today was just about just having today . and i think that we are one of those couples with a long story , when people ask how they found each other . i will see her every now and then , and . . . maybe one year she ' ll be with somebody , and the next year , i ' ll be with somebody , and it ' s gonna take a long time . . . and then it ' s perfect . i ' m in no rush . 
 [ enters office , somersaults onto couch , kicks over painting and lamp ] parkour ! 
 [ standing on tractor trailer with dwight and andy , looking down ] okay , we all go together or we go one at a time . 
parkoooooour ! 
 [ entering break room ] who ' s getting married ? 
if somebody doesn ' t tell me , i ' m gonna start screaming . 
oh ! hey , i hired them ! matchmaker ! this place is like spaniard fly . 
did everybody know about this but me ? 
 [ shaking head disgustedly ] okay . . . okay . [ leaves room ] 
 [ approaches dwight ' s desk ] you ' ll never guess what i know . 
eric likes megan . 
 [ annoyed ] how do you know this ? 
i hate , hate , hate being left out . whether it ' s not being picked for a team , or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn ' t exist . or that the sport doesn ' t exist ? i should ' ve known . poopball ? 
 [ to maurie , the asian intern ] man , i know how you feel . third wheel . i have been the third wheel so many times in my life . my mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better . she said " the third wheel is what makes it a tricycle . " 
i ' m talking about your group date with megan and eric . 
yes 
well . . . 
 [ confused ] stanley was on your group date ? 
 [ laughs ] does anybody else know about this ? 
 [ laughs , looks to camera excitedly ] 
there he goes . there he goes . [ stanley gets up from his desk , walks into kitchen area ] 
so , what is the scuttlebutt ? anybody hear anything ? 
nothing ? well i got a little somethin ' somethin ' . i don ' t know if i should say . . . 
stanly is having a midlife crisis . 
well apparently , he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people . 
who ? 
 [ starts to speak , says nothing , walks away ] 
 [ entering break room , to maurie ] you stupid son of a bitch . you set me up . 
stanley ' s wife is out of town . 
oh , was he ? well who , his sister ? 
 [ upset ] i don ' t get it ! 
drugs ? 
 [ fumbling for words ] mmm . . . okay . uhh . . . hmm . . . okay . never mind . carry on . 
 [ approaching kelly ' s desk , whispering ] stanley is having an affir . 
i am very happy right now . thrilled perhaps , to be part of the office , to be part of the conversation . when you have somebody ' s attenton , and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say , [ michael is seen whispering to jim , then pam ] that is a great feeling , and i experienced that firsthand today . it is wonderful to be the center of attention . 
 [ motioning to pad of paper with hangman game , spelling out " s _ an _ ey is chea _ in _ _ n _ eri ] that and that are the same letter . 
no . . . no . he ' s holding a pencil . he could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil . what ' s that letter , right there ? same letter here and here . what haven ' t you guessed ? 
t ! yes ! yes ! that is a " t " , and there ' s another one right there . just sound that out . you ' re almost there . 
 [ opening blinds as stanley walks past ] hey , stanley ! where you goin ' , big guy ? up to no good ? 
no , no , no , no . i just had a quick question for you . i ' m casting a movie and i ' m looking for a woman who can dance , beautiful woman . do you know anybody ? 
pays five million dollars . nudity required . 
 [ giddy , whispering ] did you hear stanley ' s having an affair ? 
oh , okay , i get it . you feel out of the loop , and you feel sorry for yourself , and it ' s really sad because everybody thinks you ' re a loser . . . 
 [ stares at jim silently , then walks away ] 
 [ in parking lot , blocking path of stanley ' s car ] stop . hold up , hold up , hold up ! no , no , no . time to stop being polite and get real . [ stanley honks horn repeatedly ] stanley , are you having an affair ? 
so it ' s not true . okay , well . . . ahhh , those interns , they told me they saw you at a club , and they all said it was you , it was clearly just . . . racial profiling gossip . 
 [ nodding ] so stupid ! 
i know , i know . 
oh , i bet . 
wait , hold , hold , hold . . . so it is true ? 
oh my god ! wait a second , do people often say they ' re going on sales calls and then go someplace else ? ' cause that ' s not cool . 
 [ muttering ] i ' m not saying . . . a damn thing . 
 [ looking afraid ] you can count on me . 
 [ entering kitchen area ] oh , that smells good . 
did you hear about angela ? that ' s pretty weird . 
well , the fact that she is apparently dating an 81 - year - old billionaire . owns a quizno ' s on the turnpike . 
uh huh . [ gestures to kevin to keep it quiet ] alright ? 
how do you un - tell something ? you can ' t . you can ' t put words back in your mouth . what you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that ' s been said is untrue , including " stanley is having an affair . " it ' s like the end of spartacus . i ' ve seen that movie half a dozen times , and i still don ' t know who the real spartacus is , and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit . 
yeah . 
anorexia . she ' s an anorexatic . 
nothing can be done , we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best i guess . 
 [ to kelly ] i ' m worried about erin , because she ' s not a very good worker . i don ' t know how long she ' s gonna last here . 
yeah . so . . . and andy is gay . 
mm hmm . 
 [ whispering to meredith ] did you hear pam is pregnant ? 
yeah ! 
 [ whispering ] guys , guys . . . you can ' t believe everything you hear . like stanley , having an affair ? that is crazy ! it ' s just . . . there ' s no stalking it . it ' s a weird day for false facts . let it go . 
 [ with everyone assembled in conference room ] okay everybody , big day . last day for our interns , a lot of other stuff . . . who knows what to believe ? dwight , the honors . 
 [ entering conference room ] yeah , yeah . . . you know what ? let ' s discredit these rumors . 
that ' s not important , jim , i just think we shouldn ' t listen to any of that crap . 
 [ quietly leaves room ] 
nowhere . 
 [ reluctantly exits elevator ] 
 [ to everyone , in conference room ] okay , i made it all up . 
yes . 
but guys , i ' m a victim here too , okay ? people here have been saying that i ' m a j . crew model . 
jim ? no , no . i spread the rumor that somebody here was a j . crew model , and i was referring to myself . 
because a lot of people think that models , even though they ' re very attractive , are somewhat vapid . it ' s set our industry back quite a bit . 
okay , okay . . . here ' s the thing . there was one true rumor out there today . i didn ' t want everybody to know what it was . so all of you are off the hook , except for this one person . 
 [ sighs ] the one true rumor , and this is going to ruin this person ' s life , is that . . . 
alright , alright . . . you know , this is not the truth , and you can ' t fall on the sword this way . the real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair . 
yes . jim . . . 
look at that ! [ grabs sonogram from pam ] that is the inside of your vagina ! [ jim takes sonogram from michael ] 
 [ to jim and pam ] how long have you known about the pregnancy ? 
a week ? a month ? a year ? 
did you pee on a stick ? 
you should ' ve told me . 
 [ phone rings , hits speaker button ] 
 [ gasps ] 
oh , oh . . . yeah , a long time ago , just to make sure she was out of town . oh . . . oh god . 
no , i have to take it , or it ' ll seem suspicious . 
no , no , i can do this . 
yes , i can . i am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo , and i need her help . we will haggle about money , and then i will back down , and then i won ' t talk to her until this whole cynthia thing has blown over . 
 [ picking up phone ] hey , what up , cynthia ? [ lowers phone , looking terrified ] 
hold on a second , cynthia . 
well , it turns out that teri was already suspicious , because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago . so stanley promised that he would stop , and he did , end of story . well , not exactly . [ camera pans down from michael ' s office window to parking lot below , stanley is seen destroying michael ' s sebring with a crowbar ] uhh , cynthia kept calling him , she would not stop calling him , and she was in love with him . oh , and get this . cynthia , also married . so . . . you can ' t stop love , i guess [ jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as pam smiles ] and quite frankly , i don ' t think you should ever try . 
 [ knock at michael ' s office door ] yeah ? 
yes , oscar come on in . close the door if you would . thank you , thanks so much for talking to me . 
i ' m going in for a procedure today . 
yeah , it ' s routine . i ' m just a little bit scared . 
it is a colonoscopy . 
in your experience , what should i be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions ? [ oscar looks irritated and frustrated ] is there anything i can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for dr . shaundry ? 
my main concern , should i have a safe word ? 
abso . . . you know what ? i ' ll do you one better , sunday , sunday night . 
ho , hol , hold on big guy , i ' m gonna put it in the mail sunday night and you ' ll get it weds . 
oh right , this thing . i remember now . [ whispers to jim ] what ' s this about ? 
it ' s okay with me but he ' s gonna want me in there . 
really ? 
alright , do you mind if it sit this out ? i have so much work to do , i feel like i ' m gonna blow my brains out . 
am i worried that jim and david are having a meeting without me ? no , because we are the three amigos . and once in awhile one of the amigos will go off . . . to the bathroom . . . while the other two have a secret meeting . [ shrugs ] 
hey let me escort you to your desk . 
you and jim are close , huh ? 
hey , what do you think he and david are talking about ? what do you . . . 
well , you said good luck to jim as he walked in . 
if you are lying to me right now pam , your baby is gonna come out a liar . that ' s how it works . they inherit things through the breast milk . 
i just don ' t want you to lie to me . i don ' t want you to ever lie to me . have i ever lied to you ? 
i just don ' t want you to . 
 [ walks into conference room on his cell phone , interrupting david and jim ] uh huh , well if he doesn ' t like it you can tell that sob that he is fired . sorry , i ' m going into a meeting right now . i will . . . i love you too . bye . 
sorry about that . what ' d i miss ? 
do not mind ! yes , i do ! no , i don ' t . yes , i do ! no , i don ' t mind . catch you guys on the flippity flop . oh this . . . call waiting . [ answers his phone ] yeah , uh huh , well you tell the mayor he just lost six votes . 
yeah . 
nope . 
no , i think they ' re talking about me . 
what is jim telling him ? that i can ' t handle this job ? that ' s bull crap . that is bull crap . although , it has been chaotic lately . corporate shut down the buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients . i will tell you there has been work everyday . had to come in on a saturday . to retrieve . . . i left my cell phone here . 
 [ staring into the conference room ] how are your sales doin ' ? 
shhh , i ' m just trying to figure out what ' s going on in that room , okay ? 
wallace had to show up on the one four month period that i ' m completely overwhelmed . 
you know when they say it ' s so crazy it just might work ? well , i don ' t believe that . i say go for the air - tight plan and that is why i am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart . it is just elegant . 
 [ in the cheese cart ] be my eyes . 
 [ crawls out of the cheese cart unseen ] hey , hey , you must have walked right past me . how you doin ' ? 
yes , definitely . 
look who you ' re talking to . 
well i would say that my greatest talent is being the best man , woman , or child , to have ever run this branch , ever . 
 [ looks at jim ] permission to speak on the record ? 
jim is like big bird . he is tall and yellow and very nice . but would i put him in charge ? no , i don ' t think so . because big bird doesn ' t make the tough decisions . i . . . if i was gonna put someone in charge , i would put burt in charge or i would put one of the real grown - ups in charge , like maria or gordon , maybe . 
very much , jim is my best friend . but it ' s his performance report . . . right here . now this was written by toby , who we all know is extremely reliable . 
it ' s not very well written , but you get the gist . 
i can just continue to run it myself . 
this was jim ' s idea ? 
wow . ummm , well i ' d have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block . 
 [ after talking to david , jim looks dejected ] i can ' t help but feel partially responsible . 
 [ shakes jelly beans ] little pick me up ? [ jim accepts ] oh those are the best . little sugar rush . 
well we did talk about how handsome you are . 
oh what a week , god . we said . . . i know there were certain things we said . . . 
hmmm , that ' s weird , that ' s weird . . . it ' s kinda weirding me out . did you know that lincoln ' s secretary was named kennedy . 
tell you what , when you leave this office i am going to call wallace and i am going to tell him that you should get that promotion . 
yes ! 
yes . 
hey david , this is michael scott . [ jim pushes speaker phone button ] michael scott here . 
just wanted to talk to you about jim halpert . i understand that he did not receive the promotion . and i wanted to see what i could do to nudge you in the right direction . 
absolutely , [ turns speakerphone off ] not . [ turns speakerphone back on ] like i said before , jim is fantastic and he deserves this job . 
wha . . . here ' s the thing , jim is the best man for this job , i think you should give it to him . 
well , nnnn , that . . . that was an anomaly . that file had been falsified . toby flenderson is doing drugs . 
hey , hey jim , it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face . alright , just do it . 
i never recommended you because i didn ' t want to lose you and i didn ' t want to lose pam , [ starts to choke up ] and now i don ' t wanna lose the baby . 
that ' s what she . . . 
kind of in the middle of something here . 
i , yeah . . . no , i ' ll tell him myself . let ' s both . 
 [ on phone ] hello . 
no , it ' s just us . 
oh , oh , well here he is right now . [ michael knocks on desk ] come in . [ makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to jim to answer ] 
well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager . 
i like that , so manager and co - manager . 
well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager . 
okay everybody , i have an announcement to make . . . whoa do you have an announcement ? 
everybody , david wallace and i have talked and we have decided to promote jim to the position of co - manager . 
of your butt , and your butt , and your butt , all of the scranton branch butts . 
what ' s happening to me ? i am also being promoted to co - manager , we will be co - managers together . jim halpert , welcome . 
no way , no how . expense reports are a day - to - day item . that is jim ' s now . i am exclusively big picture , epic . 
that is not big picture . 
 . . . okay . 
that is not - - okay - - that is day - to - day . 
you ' re trying to trick me . 
get out , get out , get out , get out , get out . 
everyone , now would be a good time to freshen up , because i ' d like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes . and i suggest that you bring a snack , because we may be in there for a while . 
yes ? 
mmm , sure , but could i first talk to you in my office ? 
welcome . 
mm - hmm . 
disruptive . 
no , i don ' t think they are . i think the meetings are very important . 
let ' s do . 
n - - well , to be fair , jim . . . james . . . jimothy . . . to be fair , jimothy , the - - ah , that sounds weird . are you okay with being called jim ? 
alright . jim , to be fair , the conversation wasn ' t about planets . . . 
at first , we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper . and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon ? so you draw a line from there to the other planets , and i think by the end , we all learned a little bit about how small we are . 
because it ' s a big universe , and we ' re all just little , tiny specks of dust . 
you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps . you go to sleep , it ' s light out , you wake up , it ' s dark . that ' s the whole day . where did that day go ? i have no idea . 
yes . 
alright . no more meetings this week . 
i can be very suprising . 
mm - hmm ? 
yeah , just focus - grouping a product expansion idea to these folks . got one of each . 
stanley , you don ' t need to answer that . 
what do you mean by " these people " ? 
oh , hey , everybody , i think that jim has gone insane , because he thinks that my office is a conference room . 
listen , jim , no offense , but when push comes to shove , what i want is more important that what you want . 
what do you guys think ? [ all start talking at the same time ] 
no , no , no , you don ' t need to go anywhere . anything that jim has to say to me , he can say in front of these types of people . 
that is not what wallace told us . 
that is not the way i heard it . 
it is one thing , me giving you the co - manager title . it is another thing , you bossing me around . 
no , no , no . no , we will not call david wallace . [ michael pulls out his cell phone ] i will call david wallace . 
or david wallace will call us on line two . why don ' t we just - - 
hey david , this is michael , senior co - manager . 
got it , dave . sounds like your classice big - picture decision . 
which is it more of ? 
i thought maybe we could talk after this is over . 
no , it will not be . i am on top of it . 
talk to you later - - [ jim hangs up ] okay , you didn ' t let me say good - bye . [ sighs , and claps hands once ] alright , i am looking forward to this . 
i hate the fact that we have to do this together . i think we work better separately . when i am irritated and i look at you , i don ' t see you anymore . 
all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are . 
you know , there ' s no easy way to do this . i say we add 1 . 5 % to their paychecks and don ' t say anything about it . 
no , we can do it during the day . it doesn ' t have to be that dramatic , jim . 
jim , don ' t take this the wrong way . are you gonna take this the wrong way ? 
you use your brain too much . 
sometimes the smartest people don ' t think at all . 
as i was saying it . 
 [ in nerdy voice ] con - - you look like a nerd . 
pro - - you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds . 
con - - you unzip your pants , and you find that there ' s a calculator down there . 
that will not go over well . 
oh , my god ! are you gonna make another pro and con list ? i ' m gonna kill myself . 
no ! i could not do that , jim . i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect . if i can just think this through , if i could just think it exactly right , i can make this perfect , and then i can go down every avenue , and every avenue off of that avenue , and then another avenue . 
and then another - - 
oh , i do ? ! tell me what they are . 
ha ! that - - i am not known for that ! 
yes ! you went over my head to wallace ! 
okay . well , why don ' t you tell me what those are , jim ? why don ' t you enliven me ? 
ah . 
okay , here ' s a tough decision for you . you suck ! you suck ! is that clear enough for you ? ! 
okay , skippy , here we go . why don ' t you run yourself out there and tell them ? [ laughs ] you call it . 
 [ to the camera ] this had better be terrible . 
that was good ! that was good ! okay , all right . well , we all know it ' s hard to be a boss , right ? you know what ? look around you . these are your best friends . these are the people who will open their hearts to you . they all have heart - ons for you [ someone growns in disgust ] , and that is a gift . so in terms of gifts , we should be giving each other gifts . angela , yes , lend oscar a cup of sugar . this - - 
my plan - - a man - - panama . 
alright ! let me get this clear ! does everybody want a raise ? [ all say yes ] alright , everyone wants a raise , so what we ' re going to do is go into here , and we will not come out until we do . 
what about a raise based on merit ? 
mm - hmm . piece of cake . ryan , obviously the best . 
are you making a - - 
toby . 
just wanted to draw a picture of him . 
alright ! who to pick ? [ walking around the table ] who to pick ? 
i . . . will skip a turn . 
i need more time . 
hey , what are you guys doing in here ? 
 [ leaving his office , hurrying to jim ' s office ] 
 [ in jim ' s office ] how you doing ? 
oh , what are you usually ? 
usually a ten , but i ' m feeling like a zero . 
i know , i know . 
yes , we did . 
um , nothing . i just . . . i used to have to do this part alone , and it was the worst . i have something i would like to give you . [ leaves office ] 
you ' re welcome . 
gin . [ toast , sip ] 
 [ someone knocks ] just pretend we ' re not here . 
 [ standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding ] what do you think ? i spent all morning on it . 
it ' s just a really important day for me . 
thanks . 
yes she does . yes she does . we ' re all gonna go and we ' re gonna have a good time . [ hugs angela ] 
no . 
and , hey , don ' t embarrass me when we go to niagara . 
don ' t . don ' t . don ' t . you stole my joke . don ' t steal my joke . 
yes . i said that yesterday . 
dwight . . . 
no . no . no . please , please . dwight , that ' s my joke . 
this is what i ' m talking about . when we leave here and go up to niagara falls we are representing dunder mifflin , everyone . this is a very important wedding for the branch . the most important wedding until i get married . so , i want you all on your best behavior or so help me , god . so . . . i will see you up there in viagra falls ! 
pam and jim ' s wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe . 
get out of here . 
oh , my god , dwight . 
there ' s . . . a name . 
oh . well , tell me about jocelyn . 
ok . 
is that all you have on her ? 
you ' re an idiot . 
 [ in car , michael driving ] oh ! god ! wow ! oh . i was asleep . 
those glasses are super dark . 
alright . we need some tunes , i think . 
you did ? 
that was nice of you . 
oh , very thoughtful . a little mix to set the mood . delightful . pop that in . 
are you serious ? you want me to play that for a woman coming to my room ? 
no . no . that ' s not how it works . 
hello . reservation for michael scott . 
mmm - hmm . 
i don ' t have a reservation but i want a room in the halpert - beesly block of rooms . 
dwight . dwight , dwight . i need to stay in your room .

yes . 
yes . . . just go - - 
oh . thank god . 
um . . . no . and you know what ? i would say yes but you can ' t . and i ' ll tell you why . 
if i have a woman up there and things are getting amorous , she ' s going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay . 
ok . 
i don ' t have a room ? 
ok . ' oooh . you must pass the dungeon wisdom test . ' 
jerk . 
when mary was denied a room at the inn . . . jesus was born . when michael was denied a room at the inn , we don ' t know what happens because that story hasn ' t been told yet . 
hey . stanley ? can i stay in your room tonight ? 
not in the same bed . in the other bed . 
you . . . are . . . kidding me . 
i ' m not a physics major , stanley . i ' m just saying be careful . hey , guys . hey . could i stay in your room tonight ? 
that ' s rude . 
you are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life , so you just get used to it . 
yeah , yeah , yeah . she ' s very conservative . so , mum ' s the word . 
how ya doin ' ? 
nice to meet you . 
who ' s doing a toast ? i would like to go third . sort of bat clean up and - - 
 [ talking quietly , trying not to move his lips ] that is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives . 
didn ' t move my lips . 
head table , where i belong . 
well , who ' s that one ? 
what am i supposed to do with that , dwight ? 
they have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong . i would kill with the brother stuff . it should be me . . . up there . it should be me and pete , not pete and tom . 
that ' s not appropriate . hello . hi , everybody . i promised i wasn ' t gonna make a toast and i ' m not going to . just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim , then so be it . hey , what is the deal with the smart car ? how smart is that ? those things are tiny . can you even drive them in traffic ? ' i ' m so smart . e = mc . . . squared . i drive a smart car . ' that ' s not smart in my book . the real smart car is kitt from knight rider . 
that ' s a car that can talk . can smart car talk ? nope . 
that ' s not smart . and also , chitty chitty bang bang . [ no one is laughing ] 
and . . . you . . . everybody can laugh . it doesn ' t have to just be the idiots . everybody can laugh . 
yeah . go ahead . 
 [ clears throat ] ok . ok . hey . what i think jim is trying to say is that . . . they had an accident and you know what ? these two people , they ' re living together , they ' re having lots of consentual sex - - 
yes . yes they were living together . yes and you know what ? you can ' t expect them to be careful every time . because , frankly , it ' s just a different sensation . 
when you c - - well ? am i wrong ? they say it ' s not different , but it ' s a different sensation . 
when you use something to block - - i think everybody knows what i am talking about . it ' s not necessarily different for the woman - - 
 . . . but it ' s different for the - - ok . ok . 
alright . my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema , i hope you heard every word . 
jim . 
that was a little touch and go at first but i think we saved it . 
i know . i can ' t believe it was you , either . i actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me . 
i have not found that to be the case . 
can you believe it ? he screwed up , not me . 
there ' s gonna be a free room ? 
hi , mema . it ' s michael . 
yes . yep . one in the same . may i ? 
i am actually great with old women . in fact , for the longest time , my best friend was my grandma . . . and then she met harriet and now she thinks she ' s better than everybody . 
oh . ok . well . . . hook you up , there . [ turns off tv ] 
you ' re welcome . 
oh . isn ' t he terrible ? may i ? here ' s the thing . umm . . . mema , i think you just need to chill out about this whole pam getting pregnant thing . it ' s not 1890 anymore . it ' s modern day . and women have sex before marriage and i think we need to celebrate that . and i know in your day she would be considered a whore but , now , women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them . that ' s part of life . 
exactly . 
i know . 
they ' re gonna name the baby after you , you know . they ' re gonna call it mema . 
yes , and if it ' s a boy they will call it sylvio . 
what are you wearing ? 
looks like you ' re going to a fish fry , dwight . 
ok . [ dwight howls ] that ' s not appropriate . [ dwight continues howling ] uncool . uncool , dwight . [ they both howl ] ok . ok . come on . let ' s go . [ both howl as they exit ] 
dwight , dwight . shut up about the farm . it ' s not relatable . nobody owns a farm . 
 [ talking to an attractive woman ] toy story , finding nemo , up . i ball the entire time . i can not watch pixar . 
yes . 
why ? 
oh , my god . twins . i ' m sorry . you understand . nice to meet you . 
they ' re men , dwight . 
something is wrong with you . 
 [ over phone ] is that pam ? hey , have her come out ! have her come out ! it would be like coyote ugly . 
 [ over phone ] i love you ! [ laughs ] 
mmm ! it ' s after midnight . [ points at jim ] 
oh my god . you ' re not going to be able to talk back . 
she ' ll be sitting home saying , " jim . . . take the baby to the zoo cause i want to sit at home and eat bon - bons . " [ dwight laughs ] " and . . . and clip my toenails . " 
now you sound like kermit . 
 [ folding his pants on top of the ice machine , man walks in with ice bucket ] why don ' t you take a picture . it ' ll last longer . god . can ' t i get a little privacy ? 
 [ passes isabel ] hey , good morning . [ to dwight ] it ' s about damn time . i haven ' t gone to the bathroom in a day and a half . [ walks into hotel room ] oh my god , dwight . this room is a pit . 
 [ watching dwight eat breakfast ] how can you eat like that ? 
yeah , i ' m hungry , but i ' m not going to make a pig out of myself . 
she was cute . you know ? she was hot . she was very hot . she made love like a tiger . 
she was from europe . 
uh - huh . 
no . 
wait a second . you ' re not into her ? are you kidding me ? 
she ' s pam ' s best friend . you guys could double date . swap maybe ? 
no . . . you ' re crazy . 
she ' s - - okay . do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist ? you have to take x - rays . you have to scrape the plaque off of people ' s teeth . you have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they ' re not scared when the dentist comes in . it - - it - - 
 [ stands up and walks away ] i already have my european girlfriend . 
oh , here we go . they asked for cash , but you know . . . i give them cash every week , so - - how much cash does a person need ? i have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special . i have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory . [ holds up painting ] and i have another one of them in the nude . but that one is for me . 
 [ to isabel ] hey , hey . . . he ' s not sitting with me either . where are you sitting ? you need a seat buddy ? 
oh , i wish i was a bridesmaid . where am i gonna go ? 
 [ to pam ' s mom ] hey . hi . do you - - would you have a snack in your purse ? you ' re a mom . i just figured you might have - - 
oh ! eww . . . apricot . do you have any of the very berry or ocean splash or - - 
oh . . . okay . were you saving it ? 
i ' m sorry . [ puts food in his mouth ] ugh . apricot . made of real apes . 
my weekend was bad so far . 
i came here hoping to meet somebody . you know , as you do at weddings . end up going to sleep by the vending machine . it was loud , but it was warm . 
and . . . and the love of my life is dating somebody else . 
it is a terrible year for love . 
i ' m thinking about having my sperm frozen . 
um , yeah . 
oh , wow . that sounds hilarious . i do actually . [ pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them ] there you go . use it in good health . 
 [ walks up ] yes ! yes ! i have so much joy . . . in my heart . . . right now . how do i look ? 
hey pam , did you see this ? it was on you tube . 
the fundamentals of business . the funda - mentals of business . " mental " is part of the word , i have underlined it . because you ' re mental , if you don ' t have a good time . you have to enjoy it . 
get out . 
yes . so , it all starts with a handshake . but you can ' t just go right to the selling , you need " small talk . " what topics can you use for small talk ? 
mmhm . 
mmhm . 
yes , what else ? 
no . 
yeah ! that ' s good ! come on up ! meredith , come up here . let ' s do a little something . so meredith and i have just started conversing and i will say , " so meredith , how was your weekend , what did you do ? " 
all right . . . 
okay , okay . god . what you people don ' t know about business , i could fill a book with . 
what ? 
 [ into mini recorder ] the fundamentals of business by michael scott . over one billion sold . more than the bible , i ' m not surprised . chapter one . the businessman . . . 
oh hi . i ' m sorry , just a sec . [ whispers ] erin , you ' re supposed to be the gatekeeper , do you have any idea how valuable my time is ? 
do you know how creative space works ? okay i just cancelled my afternoon . 
push free play til tomorrow morning . [ to grotti ] hi . sorry . crazy day . you ' re seeing how the sausage gets made . 
come in the conference room and i will show you a finished sausage . 
mmhm . 
yep . 
okay . 
there is nothing more insulting to a great salesman , than having to listen to a bad salesman . it ' s like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player . 
oh yup . yeah , definitely . all that paper burning up . 
mmhm , i hear you . the truck . 
okay , well . 
do your worst . [ they shake hands ] 
 [ grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat ] oh , great . 
mmhm . 
nothing , other than once again , i am just thankful that i am a paper salesman . 
no dwight , not everything is a threat . 
there is no such things as monsters . 
wait , when did we start talking about the mob ? the guy was trying to sell me insurance . 
i think , he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance . 
he did talk about a fire in the warehouse . . . and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer . 
 [ over chatter ] hey , hey hey , calm down . calm down . calm down . ryan , you lived in new york , what do you think ? 
okay . 
um it is , grotti . 
okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences . 
i ' m not gonna lock my door . [ door closes . then clicks locked ] 
it ' s grotti . he ' s following up . 
 [ reads email ] " i feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business . " 
yeah . 
yeah . what are my options here ? do i just ignore it , or ? 
okay , i ' m calling the police . 
all right . 
shh ! 
that ' s not gonna happen . 
what am i supposed to do here ? 
i was thinking exactly the same thing . 
i don ' t know , i don ' t know about that . 
hold on , hold on ! just - 
all right . i will meet with him , but i ' m not going alone . 
 [ andy dressed as a mechanic , cornell hat on ] what are you wearing ? who ' s pat ? 
let ' s go , come on . [ whispers ] god ! 
forget it ! forget it ! 
 [ andy is playing with the tire iron ] take that thing off the table ! please ! 
oh my god ! 
guys , guys . cool it . there he is , there he is . 
hello . 
mr . grotti we meet again . these are my associates . 
yes . 
well . 
okay . 
that ' s not true . 
okay shut up . 
i will have the gabba - gool . 
the gabba - gool . 
i don ' t , i don ' t have to have that . 
guys , guys - 
that ' s okay . 
shh . i will have the spaghetti , with a side salad . 
if the salad is on top , i send it back . 
i don ' t think our company actually needs any more insurance . so i am out . 
no , no no , no . come on . i ' m sorry , we ' re having our salad . 
hey , do you need any help ? 
he ' s a good mechanic . 
i don ' t . . . 
okay , okay okay . 
yep , all right . 
put it down . 
okay . 
okay . 
it ' s just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour . 
i had to make a snap decision dwight . 
it was a lot of snap decisions . 
yes ! 
just get in the car . 
jim ? 
oh thank god . 
it wasn ' t easy . i had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency . i chose massive coronary , cause you told me that your dad had a bad heart . listen man , i , i got a problem , i think i ' m in trouble with the mob . or a major insurance carrier . 
yeah , i know and you usually can get out of stuff like this , so i ' m turning to you my friend . 
okay ! 
jim ? are you ? 
what ? wait , i didn ' t hear a thing you just said . 
no ! god ! i missed , i missed the important part again ! 
no ! oh my god ! 
no , jim please , repeat what you ' re saying ! i can ' t understand you ! 
jim ? ! ? [ dial tone ] oh my god . 
hey uh , question for you . i recently purchased some insurance that i can ' t afford given my present salary . is there anything accounting - wise i can do to sort of make it all go away ? 
oh no . um . what about this cash for clunkers thing ? 
all right . well , it was a thought . thanks . 
no . he ' s not . he ' s just good . nothing sticks to him . you still don ' t understand how this works . 
but grotti acts like he ' s mafia though . 
 [ grunts ] 
if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar . i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars . bury them in my yard . and i wouldn ' t tell the cops a thing . not that i would be lying per se . but i would just get really quiet , all of a sudden . 
this is scott . 
oh really ? is that supposed to scare me ? 
well you thought wrong . because i am not pleased . i ' m actually kind of po ' d . 
i think you know exactly why , because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance . 
i think you knew exactly what you were doing . and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk . 
you suck ! 
and i ' m not gonna buy your stupid insurance . 
how about that ? the only person that actually needs insurance is you , if you show your face around here again , got it ? 
doubt it . [ disconnects call ] 
what a tool . [ dwight and andy exchange looks ] what ? 
no . what do you mean ? 
what ? 
oh man . i should be mad at you guys . but i ' m not . 
so i looked him in the eye and i said , " not today grotti , not today . and not tomorrow , and not the next day . or the day after that . and you can tell all your friends that if i see them , then they ' re already dead . " i said something like that . 
erin ? 
coffee ? 
not from the kitchen . stop and shop . if it ' s not stop and shop , i send it back . 
large . if it ' s a medium i send it back . if it ' s an extra large i send it back . 
go . any questions ? 
is there someone there ? who is there ? i hear voices , is somebody there ? 
is someone there ? i can ' t see you because i ' m blind . 
 [ gasps ] it is ? 
they ' re back ? oh ! oh ! oh , pam ! [ reaching out with hands at chest level ] 
and oh , jim . . . 
oh , i haven ' t see you since my accident that i had when i fell - i fell into the pool of acid , eyes first . blind guy . 
blind - guy mcsqueezy . how do i describe it ? it is a character i ' ve been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble . the women in my improve class absolutely hate him . [ groans ] 
 [ behind pam , acting out blind - guy , groaning ] 
i have recently taken a lover . 
pam ' s mom . 
pam ' s mom , helene . remember from your wedding ? 
about what ? 
oh , big time . 
she drives a green camry . 
and the seats go all the way down . all the way down . 
 [ laughs ] what ? 
okay , good , a pact . a pact . although i may have to break it tonight when helene and i tell pam over dinner . you alright ? 
get the hell out of here , idiot . 
i think you ' re underestimating pam . i think more than anything , she wants me to be happy . 
okay , i have a good thing with the mom - 
she ' s right on my way home from work . 
i di - alright , i ' ll take surface streets , its - the last thing in the world i would want to do is upset pam . 
yeah . 
can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two ? 
sure . thanks for asking . 
 [ unwraps rum gift ] oh , wow . 
that is amazing . i feel like a real puerto rican . 
erin , look . [ holds up parrot rum bottle ] 
yeah . 
yeah , no , it ' s nobody . 
 [ chuckles ] hmm . . . no . 
i don ' t . 
 [ sighs ] i don ' t deserve this , guys . 
no , i don ' t . 
 [ long exhale ] 
i was probably going to break up with her anyway . 
pam , it is very complicated . there are a lot of moving parts here . 
it is . 
you want me to be happy ? 
part of the problem is , she is the mother of a close friend of mine . 
more than a friend , a co - worker . 
it ' s okay . 
that could have gone one of two ways , but i never expected her to get upset . 
okay . 
 [ sighs ] feels good . 
i ' m sleeping with pam ' s mom . sometimes , dinner . 
 [ in the conference room leading a meeting ] due to a certain recent incident , corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities . 
that was a hit job . if you read the dunder mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster . so if there is a lesson to be learned here and i ' m not sure that there is , it is that in order to help our communities , we need to put other people ' s needs ahead of our own . 
who wants to help the world one step at a time ? [ dwight raises his hand ] alright , good . 
alright , that ' s . . . 
alright . . . 
okay , i ' m out of here , [ pretends to leave ] see you later guys . . . 
ok , oh no here ' s an idea . . . conservation . . . 
anybody else ? who else has an idea ? 
 [ michael leaves to answer his phone ] can you hold down the fort ? [ on phone ] hey boo ! 
 [ on phone ] what ' s it . . . why are you crying ? 
 [ on phone ] no , no , no , i ' ll talk to her . i will . . . no . . . nobody talks to my baby that way . . . uh ah . . . yeah , i ' ll let you know how it goes . alright , by pickle . 
 [ hangs up phone and walks back into conference room ] pamela morgan beesly , you need to apologize to your mother right now . 
for trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover ? 
alright , in my defense . . . 
shut up oscar . hey , alright , you know what , clearly i ' m outnumbered here , but can i just say one thing , please ? what is so wrong about me ? i ' m caring , i ' m generous , i ' m sensual . is it really so horrible that i could possibly go out and find happiness . 
let ' s get back to the matter at hand . 
no , no , no . . . no , no . . . 
i don ' t like the tone here . . . this is a place of business , you are to listen to others , you are to give others respect , and you are to keep your personal issues out of it . 
do not talk to me that way ! i am your boss and i may someday be your father , so get out . 
i hope that you are willing to die in this office , because i am . . . 
 [ walks into toby ' s office ] hey toby , could i talk to you for a minute ? 
um , i just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was . . . uncalled for , i ' m sorry . 
can i sit down for a second ? 
this is gonna sound weird , but i think i may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole pam situation . 
she brought it into the work place so i feel like it has to be dealt with here . 
really ? would you do that ? 
 [ hugs toby , who smiles big ] you ' re a good , good guy . 
no . . . that ' s . . . 
i don ' t . . . um . . . i can ' t hear your conversation . 
yeah , yeah , yeah - okay . . . you ' re a jackass . [ to pam ] hey , hey , you know what ? you ' re just as stubborn as your mother , when you don ' t wanna do something you just don ' t do it . 
you were right jim , shoulda listened to you , should never have told her . 
 [ pam storms into break room ] okay , do you want me to stop seeing your mom ? is that how we ' re gonna get past this ? cause , i will . 
well , that is not gonna happen ! 
because i assumed that you want me to be happy because i want you to be happy . 
you know what ? i ' m gonna start dating her even harder . 
you know what it means . 
i don ' t need to be friends with pam . i have plenty of female friends . my mom , pam ' s mom , my aunt . . . although she just blocked me on im , what ' s her face from quiznos , i see her four times a week . 
 [ leaving his office with his rum ] night everyone . night pam , thanks again for the rum . 
night erin . 
welcome children of the scranton industrial park community . 
join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom . don ' t worry about a thing . rest assured you will see me later . bwah ha ha . . . [ bumps into something ] . . . ha ha ha . 
i am going to scare these kids so bad . 
kids , just remember , suicide is never the answer . alright ? 
why is christmas the only holiday that can have a message ? 
it is the easy way out . you are not alone . 
who wants candy ? 
 . . . and then i think i ' m going to go to the garlic festival . 
sounds like fun . you guys would love it . 
they have a tcby booth . 
the same stuff you get downtown . 
do you like tcby ? 
i can ' t believe it ' s - i can ' t believe it ' s yogurt . uh . . . it ' ll be fun 
you should give them a call . check that out . 
jim ' s a good kid . he can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master . i , uh . . . why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional ? 
wha - what ? 
why don ' t they just want you to go by yourself ? why do they want me to come , too ? i don ' t understand . 
i don ' t want you to feel like i ' m baby - sitting you , or something . alright . 
let me get your stroller . 
what are you gonna call him ? 
no . what is his name ? 
mr . bourchard . they ' re very formal . 
yeah , well . . . this is not the phone . this is real life , baby , and you gotta own it . is that what you are wearing ? 
 . . . and that is the watch that you are going to wear ? no . it is not . you should wear this watch . i will loan it to you . it is a tankard . i highly recommend you wear that . 
they are into style . 
they are into appearance . we are selling success . 
that ' s sorta secondary . [ offers jim the watch again ] 
alright . hi . any messages ? 
uh , well , jim and i got caught in a little flash rain , flash wind , flash lightning . 
it was . it was . and then in an instant it wasn ' t . 
it rained . 
nothing . cocoa . 
good . yep . 
ok . thank you . 
 [ phone rings ] yeah ? 
ok . put them on speaker . hey guys , what ' s going on ? 
uh . . . i can ' t really hear you . i think we have sort of a bad connection . 
it was - ok . this is what it was . it was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing . 
no . maybe i was trying to save a child that had fallen in . 
not yet ! 
no it is - don ' t ! i ' m not gonna bump . i ' m not gonna bump . and it was not hilarious . it was very , very terrifying . [ stanley laughs ] 
erin , do we have any of those clips that hold paper together ? 
oh . he did ? what did he say ? 
ok . 
thank you , stanley . 
ok . 
yes . 
i can name pixar movies , too . toy story . 
i know what a flounder is . 
i ' m not usually the butt of the joke . i ' m usually the face of the joke . i wish jim had fallen into that pond and he ' d have to put on my suit and it ' d be too short and he ' d look . . . damn it ! he ' d still look good . 
the most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret . show of hands - who has been ' koi - ponded ' ? who here ' s been the butt of a joke that has gone too far ? phyllis ? 
uh . . . 
you never said anything . 
well , it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying , ' stop because i want you to stop ' or stop as in ' stop . you ' re making me laugh so hard . what you ' re doing is so funny . you are on a roll . i am busting a gut . stop ! ' 
we are going to make a ' do not mock ' list . ok ? anything that we think might be out of bounds , we put on this list . anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about . got it ? i ' m gonna kick it off . let ' s see what i have to put on the list , right ? [ writes ' koi pond ' on the list ] ok . i also have fallen into the fountain at the steamtown mall . ok . who else ? who else ? dwight , come on . 
your nose ? 
alright . 
no . i haven ' t finished writing . did you sneeze it off ? that ' s it . no more . ok . who else ? who else ? everybody ' s getting their chance . 
ok . that ' s to broad . it ' s gotta be something else . how ' bout your stomach ? yeah ? [ writes huge gut ] meredith ? 
ok . fine . come on up here . write it yourself . and don ' t sign your name to it . and nobody look . everybody look away . look away . 
ok . 
it ' s a fish . 
it could ' ve died of natural causes . so . . . 
do not mock , oscar . do not mock . how much do they want ? 
what ? no . i could get a fish for a 5 cent worm . 
no , no . 
no . we are not done here . this - 
no , jim . you don ' t understand . things like this don ' t just die . kids in high school still call me ' ponytail ' . 
yes , they do , jim . because of the time i got my ponytail stuck in the power trail . 
i want to make fun of you right now . 
no . don ' t do that . you ' re not . you ' re not stupid . 
oh , my god . 
hey . i - i just wanna say that i cannot believe that i walked into a koi pond . i mean , seriously . walk much ? [ everyone starts laughing ] oh . i should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that i go to . 
well , you know what ? you ' re right , phyllis , but i ' ve been there before . i ' ve seen that pond . this is the thing , i am a world class moron . that ' s the problem . 
it ' s ok . we ' re having fun . it ' s not actually the first time i ' ve been embarrassed by a pond . in high school , the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake . four years in a row . oh . . . it was freezing . [ jim signals for making to stop ] no . no . no . oh , this is even worse . [ michael begins to lose his cool ] couple weeks ago i went to get a new cellphone and i wanted on of those packages where you have , you know , the friends - the five - the friends and family thing and the guys was like , ' who are your 5 friends ? ' and i ' m , like , ' uh . . . ' i didn ' t even know i couldn ' t even think . [ realizing he ' s going downhill ] oh , my god . it was so embarrassing . that was - oh . i don ' t even have jan ' s cell phone number and i hate her ! she won ' t give it to me . i was like , ' oh , i guess i ' m a loser . ' a luh - whooooo a za her ' . too far ! god ! thanks a lot , man . thanks for the advice . 
hey . who wants to watch michael ' s pond dive ? my roommate ' s friend is the night janitor over there . he swiped the security tape for me and he ' s bringing it over . 
is this the tape of me falling ? 
no . it ' s ok . watch it . he can ' t fire all of you . 
it ' s alright . i can handle it . 
i am a grown - up , jim . 
i don ' t think you froze .

oscar ' s a douche .

you ' re welcome . whoa ! [ leans back ] almost fell . [ they both laugh ] 
morning dwight .

well , yeah . . . 
it worked . 
i don ' t mind if i do . 
i ' m taking one for my lady friend . 
brain food . thank you very much . 
 [ comes over to hug them both ] my girls . there they are . [ pam walks away ] 
birthday lunch . birthday lunch - - there is no better medicine than birthday lunch . it ' ll cure all of your " gee i don ' t know if michael should be dating my mother " and fixes all occurrences of " i don ' t really see them together " . so , open wide pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine . take with food . 
yeah - - 
i think everyone has meet helene . shall we ? 
no , that wouldn ' t be - - 
yeah . the rest of the story has been censored due to - - inappropriosity . 
hey - - 
please , kevin . you ' re fired . [ kevin looks at jim ; jim shakes his head ] sorry , sorry . work with a bunch of idiots . shall we go ? 
just want you to succeed pammy . you know what , we shouldn ' t even be talking about business today . 
today is about family . 
hello . scott . table for four . 
what table should we take ? so many to choose from . 
what ? all i see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations . oh , wait a second ! you mean this one ? wow ! 
not about taking credit . let ' s just say we all did it . 
well , it was actually me alone , so - - wow look at this place . really makes me want to go to italy some day . 
oh . thank you . thanks for lending me the books . 
that ' s funny . 
you ' re 54 years old . 
you ' re 58 years old ? 
congratulations . 
the only time you should care about a woman ' s age is if she is too young for you and i am not robbing the cradle . if anything i am robbing the grave . 
 [ nods uncomfortably ] that - - 
hey , would you guys ever do a triathlon , do you think ? 
helene ? 
i am . i ' m definitely going to do it . i ' ve already got the run and the bike thing down . just need to learn how to swim . come on , you in ? 
so it ' s a matter of interest . good , okay . it ' s not anything you would have ever done . 
well there ' s no jumping in a triathlon . 
you ' re thinking of the broad jump . would you try - - bungee jumping ? 
snowboarding ? 
i might . 
 [ sighs ] nothing . just life - - and doing things - - before you die . i don ' t know . 
do i really want to go snowboarding ? no . but i would like to if i wanted to . 
so we should get the check ? 
oh , no , no , no . no . it ' s stupid . you ' d hate it . i hate it . 
yes you will . 
i literally - - i put no thought into the wrapping at all . might as well of been toilet paper . 
that ' s just an arbitrary title . 
it ' s not amazing . . . at all . it ' s sort of weird that i went and did that . and now your wish won ' t come true , so that blows . 
oh that i plagiarized i think . 
i think it sucks . 
well , that ' s because you and i have very different tastes and you like lame things . it ' s a generational - - sort of gap between us . 
that was a bunt . 
oh , just went to the bathroom . 
i got thirsty . 
honestly , for a long time i thought i was going to grow old with holly . and then i met helene . and she is great and she already knows and has done everything that i have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it . but , i think i want to do those things myself . 
finish your cake , helene . 
i want you to enjoy that cake because i have something terrible i need to tell you . i want you to enjoy your cake before i tell you this terrible , terrible thing . 
helene i think you ' re a wonderful person and i - - god - - i ' ve enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much . but i have to consider pam ' s feelings as a friend and a co - worker i can not in good conscience continue to date you , when i know what this is doing to her . 
no it ' s not . 
wow . that just - - you ' ve really grown . 
 [ covering eyes ] thank you pam . and i hope you are as gracious during this next part . helene , once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and i envy it . and i want it someday , but just in the future . you need somebody who - - who understands your references . who is kafkaesque ? i ' ve never - - i don ' t know him . there ' s another woman . and her name is italy . . . and skydiving . . . and bungee jumping . 
and i want kids . and you . . . unfortunately , have already completed that part of your journey down there . 
it ' s not my decision . it ' s mother nature . and mother has very strict rules about fer - - [ waitress comes over to pour water ; long pause ] - - tility . 
well , hobbies - - 
pamela beesly halpert - - 
may i have a word with you in my office please ? 
well , this is a work related matter . 
yes . 
yes . join me please , won ' t you ? [ pam gets up and follows michael into his office ] i am going to give you a raise . 
because of all the good work you ' ve done . 
that ' s - - no , no - - it ' s not about numbers , pam . it ' s about attitude . 
do you want the raise or what ? 
hey , pam , pam - - with this raise there are strings attached . [ pam sighs ] and the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude . 
no ! no - - no i am not . unless you want me to . do you want me to ? cause i will . i will bribe you . no . your face is saying don ' t - - unless i haven ' t offered you enough . . . your face isn ' t changing . what is it ? talk to me face . tell me what pam ' s brain is thinking . come on ! what do you want ? what do you want ? do you want a million dollars ? do you want to hit me ? want me to get down on one knee and beg you or - -

 [ nervous laughter ] oh - - okay , what ? i don ' t - - are you kidding ? 
ye - - no . alright . i ' ll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just - - 
okay . 
okay . 
okay . 
see you . 
hey . 
never . about what ? a little - - what are you talking - - 
what punch ? 
i ' m pretty sure we said slap . 
i - - mmm - - i ' m good . 
hey . 
do you and pam ever get frisky ? 
i mean - - do you ever wrestle with each other ? 
really ? 
she strong ? 
can you stop this ? 
okay . 
i don ' t either . 
mmm - hmm . i know . 
you gotta do something - - 
how much time do you think you ' ll need ? 
come on , man ! 
am i scared of getting hit in the face ? no . everyday weirdo ' s pay dominatrix ' s hundreds of dollars for that very privilege . i ' m scared i ' m gonna love it . [ claps hands ] let ' s do this . 
it ' s okay guys . . . i can handle this . everybody can go home . 
you ' re just a bunch of voyeurs . are you eating popcorn ? 
yes . 
i know . [ sighs ] okay . alright . [ pam goes to punch him again ] oh - - god ! 
okay ! [ braces himself ] pam , pam - - i ' m really sorry . i ' m sorry . 
so many things . i don ' t know . it ' s hard to choose . 
maybe that - - 
yes . 
okay . i promise . [ pam starts to walk away ] for the record your mom came on to me . [ pam turns around and slaps him ; he gasps ] 
no ! 
i don ' t know . 
as i watched pam ' s big , strong hand coming towards my face i saw my entire life flash before my eyes . and guess what ? i have four kids . and i have a hover - car and a hover - house . and my wife is a runner and it shows . and pam and jim are my best friends and our kids play together . and i am happy and i am rich and i never die . it doesn ' t sound like much , but its enough for me . 
ahh . . . [ dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face ] 
oh thank you . thanks . i owe you one dwight . 
no . 
what are you talking about - - 
forget that . 
no . 
 [ pats face ] oh that feels better . 
but i would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy . 
you did ? 
that sounds like it was hilarious . 
yes ? 
you ' ll have to be more specific dwight , i get like eight emails a day . 
woo hoo , shout out ! 
erin , do we have the journal ? 
did you ? 
oh , the wall . 
it ' s $ 1 . 99 to finish the article . i wonder what it was going to say ? [ no one makes a move to pay for the article ] 
no , no , that doesn ' t make any sense . 
oh , that sounds awful . 
oh god . well , that ' s an interesting theory . 
ah , well maybe you should spy on him . [ in valley girl voice ] oh my god , wouldn ' t that be hilarious ! [ laughs ] 
ok , ok . good . i ' ll catch you on the flippity flip . bye . [ hangs up phone ] he ' s busy , he ' ll call me back when he ' s free . 
no , i ' m just poopin ' . you know how i be . 
crazy world . lotta smells . 
ok , we need some sort of distraction for everybody . anything new on youtube ? doesn ' t even need to be good . oh god , i can ' t think , need more mullins . 
monkey see , monkey do . 
monkey pee all over you . 
we have a monthly staff meeting 
 [ walks back in , on cell phone ] what ? oh my god ! [ everyone starts asking questions ] there has been a murder . there ' s been a murder in savannah . [ runs back to his office ] 
games have the power to distract people from stressful situations . battleship got me through my parents ' divorce . operation got me through my vasectomy , i . e . , my operation . i don ' t think i would have been able to endure my breakup with holly had it not been for toss across . 
it is so much fun . everybody plays a character , we go around the room , we try to figure out who did it . . . 
this is my call jim , big picture stuff , it ' s about murder . 
tube city , you owe me one . 
there will be food . you leave , you do not get food . 
sandwich platters . 
baby carrots . [ angela sits back down ] 
ok , here are your character cards . take one , pass it down . here is your prop box , some of your characters will have props . now , on your character card , it tells you who you are , and what your alibi is . everything else is up to your imagination . so , if you talk slowly in real life , your character could , say , have been kicked in the head by a horse . 
ok , use your imaginations . 
it ' s not scary . 
well how do you think i feel ? i mean i have to play caleb crawdad , handsome playboy . every night , a different woman . being oogled . having to hug and kiss and spoon , i make them feel beautiful . 
 [ looks at oscar who is using his phone , grabs it ] well , well , well . what is this contraption , i do declare ? 
who ' s michael ? i ' m caleb crawdad , i do declare . 
that is the way southern people talk . 
delta burke , i do declare . now , shall we get to the mystery ? 
no , no , no . don ' t turn this into a political thing . 
oooooo , doggie , we got a party now ! 
i do believe that the game is a big hit . people are really diving into their characters . 
 [ accent ] sir , there has been a murder , and you are a suspect . 
very good , very good . now , no one was there in the wine cellar . [ creed gets in his car and drives away ] 
 [ accent ] whoa . what ' s this strange yankee accent coming out of your mouth , son ? this here ' s savannah . 
no no no no no no no . [ accent ] i ' m going to skip forward to a relevant clue . here we go . 
 [ accent ] are you going to believe that ? that is a mis - that ' s a misdirection . we still don ' t know who the murderer is . [ everyone leaves ] nellie nutmeg , come back in here . i can ' t do this myself . voodoo mama juju . . . what am i gonna do ? 
 [ accent ] i do believe you have me mistaken , my name is caleb crawdad . y ' all skedaddled way too soon . we need to reopen this case . 
no it ain ' t . 
i already declared you , it was too dark to tell . 
this is not a game , this is my life . you are out of order , sir . 
you are out of order . 
you are - 
 [ comes into jim ' s office using accent ] deb , what in the world - do you have the vapors ? 
can ' t wait , we have to get you to our witch doctor right now . come on . come on . 
to mama juju boo boo . 
because this is the recreation of a crime scene . 
no michael here , my name is - 
no , you shut up . they need this game , jim . let us have this stupid little game , alright ? [ jim nods ] 
 [ accent ] oh , you startled me . my stars , my heart nearly leapt out of my chest . what can i do you for ? 
detective wallace ? 
aw , shucks , tell him i ' m not here . 
no , i only answer to detective wallace ' cause i got a warm body in the other room . 
a murder , you say ? i do declare . 
get in there ! 
there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue . my little heart can barely take it no more . [ regular voice ] today is the hardest i have worked in a long , long time . 
on the count of three we ' re all going to put down our guns . 
we ' ll put down our weaponry on the count of three , you ready ? 
one , two , three . . [ all scream ] 
 [ seated ] ok . ok . how ' bout this ? [ rises , waves , sits back down ] 
i want it to be better than ' great ' , pam . how ' bout i remain seated . . . and i just do a little bit of a nod . sort of a humble thing . [ demonstrates ] 
nope . then my face is down . they can ' t see my face . 
alan brand is the ceo of the company , if title ' s important to you , has personally invited moi to go to new york to the shareholder ' s meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors . and at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have . and then michael scott turns and waves to the crowd . . . and the crowd goes wild . 
ok . obviously i ' m not going to do the twirl . i only did it because i nailed the wave . 
i am not going to do the twirl . alright ? it ' s not even a twirl , it ' s a spin . i might do the spin . 
ok , oscar , i don ' t need the whole enchilada just the bullet points . 
well , could you condense it please ? 
it ' s not a limo . it ' s a town car . town cars are actually better , though . better torque . better handling . 
they sent a limo . 
town cars suck . town car is something that a company sends when they ' re in trouble . a limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration . and in this case i think we are celebrating me . 
 [ everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo ] oh , wait . wait . wow . wow ! oh , no way . look at that . 
hate to break it to you oscar but some of us like boobs . 
hey , you know who you should be jealous of ? yourself . because you ' re invited and you ' re invited and you ' re invited and you and you and you and you and you and you - 
what ? 
the limo seats eight . ok . then jim and pam and ryan plus a guest . 
 [ others start raising their hands to be picked ] mmm . . . whoa . 
 [ in the limo with dwight , andy and oscar ] i wish the windows weren ' t tinted so people could see us in here . 
definitely . 
definitely . look they got pillows . that . that ' s bigger than my bed . 
 [ the limo driver raises the divider window ] who ' s playing with the button ? 
i will have to answer . 
no , no . that ' s too hard . say your name is zamboni and then i will say , ' well , we ' re sort of on thin ice . ' [ they all laugh ] i won ' t say that . i ' ll something like that . 
oh , my god . this is it . 
yes . 
oh , hi . 
well , thank you and , and please call - continue to call me mr . scott . 
well , i guess this is as far as i can take you guys . so - 
see you later . 
 [ walking past bodyguards at the door ] officers . thank you . 
thank you . 
hello . 
thank you . 
oh . it was awesome . very , very sublime . 
it ' s nice to meet you , too . it ' s an honor and a privilege . 
ah . [ bows ] your eminence . 
you guys ever protect the president ? 
what about madonna ? or obama twins ? anybody famous ? 
rock and roll . [ they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone ] 
 [ to david ] this is not as much fun as i thought it would be . 
 [ accidentally into his microphone ] we ' re going bankrupt , you think ? [ angry jeering from the crowd ] they are really angry . 
hey , hey , hey . i ' m sorry . these are not criminals . they are nice . they invited me to come here today . they invited me to their hospitality suite where i had free food and it was delicious . get this . know how nice they are ? the sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in scranton . that ' s - 
yes . 
 [ board of directors has started to exit ] yeah , well , that ' s not gonna happen . that ' s not gonna happen . we ' ll be back with some answers . [ a few murmurs from the crowd of ' what answers ? ' ] i - ok . i know that you ' re mad at me and you ' re mad at all them - 
ok . alright . we are gonna - we ' re gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan . we ' re gonna come back with a plan for you . it ' s a 45 day plan . 45 days to get us back on track . [ crowd starts to agree and perk up ] 45 points . it ' s a 45 day / 45 point . one point per day . we get the 45 points we are back in business . [ crowd applauds ] and you can take that to the bank . [ applause continue ] and limo lady , we are going completely carbon neutral . [ crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering ] i love you , new york ! [ michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage ] you . you . 
wow . things are really picking up . 
what ? 
i did wave . i did a lot more than wave . 
we tell them the plan , right ? 
here ' s what we ' re gonna do . the 45 day thing that i outlined , we go with that . day 45 , company saved . day 44 , go . what do we got ? we have 15 minutes . 
just whatever comes to mind . shout it out . 
i am the guy who roused that crowd . 
got them on their feet . 
they were so happy down there . 
ok . alright . well , i know a guy . this mexican guy . he is a math whiz . he knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and i am going to call in a little favor . 
well , i ' m texting him , so . 
it ' s done . [ oscar , sitting in the lobby , receives a text ] 
oh . there he is . come on in . come on in . gentleman , i would like you to meet oscar . come on in . don ' t be shy . this is oscar martinez . oscar , why don ' t you come over here . let me present you . step up . step up there . oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky , murky situation . take it away . [ oscar stands there stunned ] 
tell them what you told me . this is genius . 
tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all - 
it ' s all good . it ' s all good stuff . lay it on them . 
that wasn ' t what you were saying to me . he was much more articulate and that was better . much better . 
o - kay . oh . . . hey , hey . [ follows oscar into the hall ] what are you doing ? 
wow , man . that - 
that was embarrassing . 
for me , too . you embarrassed me . 
well , that was a waste of a text . let ' s get down to brass tacks . i think that we might be in trouble . we don ' t seem to have a plan so i ' m thinking i go down there . maybe rattle off a few jokes . congressman could follow . 
uh , i ' m not a moron . time after time my branch leads in sales . i have personally won over 17 dundie awards . so , i am not a moron and i am just trying to help , you know ? so . . . you ' re the moron . 
 [ zipping through the hall while texting ] 
yes it is a thrill to be honored by one ' s company . to have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say , ' wow . great job . ' that is what it is all about . not the perks . perks ? the perks . i could take or leave the perks . limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan . so we ' re leaving early . after all , we are the only ones with anything to celebrate . 
 [ running out of the building with oscar , andy , and dwight ] oscar ! oscar ! come on ! there he is ! there he is ! go ! go ! go ! go ! go ! go ! go ! scranton ! scranton ! scranton ! dunder mifflin ! 
yeah , have a seat . 
okay , right there is the problem . there have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk . 
i have it on good authority that you said the following . [ hands andy a notecard ] can you read that back to me ? 
mmm - hmm . 
okay . 
you are also on record as saying " wittle - ittle , " " footy - wutties , " " nummies , " " jammies , " " make boom - boom , " " widiculous , " and " wode iwand . " 
you can ' t be a baby in the office . it makes me look like i hire babies . 
okay , who said that ? 
 [ elvis voice ] well , thank you . . . thank you a lot . and for what it ' s worth i think your baby voice is tops . 
 [ as elvis ] you ' re welcome , baby . 
keep . 
i want to keep those so i can see what i sent . 
keep . 
for what ? 
oh okay . i don ' t know how those got on there . . . 
must be hackers . 
what if i told you i had done the worst thing ever , would you still want to be my friend ? 
worse than that . 
lurk much ? [ erin leaves ] i miss pam . 
is that what we ' re going for now ? " okay ? " we used to go for " pretty good . " 
yeah , you know what , that actually might make me feel better . i ' m not in this for the trophies , but . . . 
well , technically , i ' m a co - manager , and i barely have any responsibilities , but i work hard , i love this company , and for those reasons , i think i would make a good employee of the month . 
it would look good , on my mantle . 
there you are . i don ' t think we have finished with my inbox . 
to change lives . 
yeah , okay . call the school , cancel . i can ' t go through with this . 
well . . . 
no . 
i just , i fell in love with those kids . and i didn ' t want to see them fall victim to the system , so i made them a promise . i told them that if they graduated from high school , i would pay for their college education . i ' ve made some empty promises in my life , but hands down , that was the most generous . 
just tell me it is going to be okay , all right ? 
i ' m not a bad person , i bring good news . like when i promised those kids i ' d pay for college . okay , all right . 
would you come with me ? you know , like old times , instead of . . . [ makes yuck face at erin ] 
agh , god , you know what , could this day get any worse ? 
hey , mikela lasker , how are you ? 
good to see you . where ' s your saxaphone ? 
eigth grade graduation , she gave a rendition of when the saints go marching in that would blow your freaking mind . 
well , you didn ' t even hear it . 
oh , good . 
sure . 
oh , yeah . 
no , not at all . nope , come on . 
oh , you know what ? you know what ? i shouldn ' t go in there . i ' m pretty busy , i should just . . . 
oh . 
wow ! 
 [ crying ] oh , god . oh , god . 
all right . wow . um , i am never going to forget today . not a chance . i don ' t think i could ever give back to you what you have given me today . who here has done something stupid in their lives ? like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between " a " gym and " b " gym , that sort of thing ? show of hands , anybody , yes , a bunch of you , okay . well , me too , i ' ve done something stupid which i would like to share . ummm . [ period bell rings ] should we go ? 
ah . all right . i came here today because i promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable . but you know what ' s invaluable is intuition . you know what that is ? that is the ability to know when something is about to happen . does anybody out there have intuition ? know what ' s gonna happen next ? nobody ? okay , you ' re going to make me say it . all right , i am so proud of all of you . derrick , and lefevre , and ben , and ayana , and mikela , and nikki and jason , and . . . i ' m sorry , okay , sorry spacing , your name ? 
well zion , i am not going to be paying for your college tuition . which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybody ' s tuition . i ' m so , so sorry . 
i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry . i ' m so sorry . 
i lied to myself too . i ' m not a millionaire . i thought i would be by the time i was 30 , but i wasn ' t even close . and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40 , but by 40 , i had less money than when i was 30 . maybe by my 50s , i don ' t know . i wanted to pay for your education . i really did . it was my dream . some people have evil drems , some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams . my dream was in the right place . 
okay , hold on . hold on . now i can ' t pay for your college . but you don ' t have to go to class to be in class . online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience . and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop . [ students perk up ] which is rendered useless without batteries , and i have one for each of you . 
hey , hold - hold on , hold on , hold on , hold on . they ' re lithium . 
erin , can you give us a second ? 
yeah . yeah . i know , i know , i know , i ' m sorry . 
what can i do ? 
i can give you an extra laptop battery . not everyone took one . how about this ? if you can find a way to pay for your college tuition , let me buy your books , okay ? 
yeah , well , i owe you that at least , right ? 
really ? wow . that ' s over $ 200 a year . 
for - okay , okay here ' s what i ' m gonna do . i ' m going to write 4 checks for $ 1 , 000 each . i ' m going to date them one year apart . now , you are to use one check a year . and please call me before you cash the check ? cause i ' ve got monies to move around . 
that ' s a lot of zeroes . 
please stop . 15 lives . i destroyed 15 young lives today . 
yes . 
you ' re what , like , 12 ? 
i think you ' re doing a great job . 
what do you want from this job , provided the company doesn ' t go out of business ? 
really ? 
you know , when i hired kevin , he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse . 
yeah . i just sort ' ve had a feeling about him . i have a feeling about you too . 
heeeeeere ' s santa ! hey little girl , what would you like for christmas ? ooh , you have been a very naughty girl , i see . [ points to pam ' s ' pregnant tummy ] 
what the hell is going on ? 
phyllis , jim ? phyllis is santa ? 
phyllis ? 
take it back . that is absurd . 
no ? no ! jim ! come on ! 
it ' s insane ! a woman santa , where does it stop ? no ! jim , this may be the last christmas that we have here , doesn ' t it make you a tiny bit anxious , me not playing santa ? come on ! 
fine ! then do it anonymously . ransom note style . you can - i - you know what , i have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk . you can use those . 
if this were russia , yeah sure . everyone would go to one santa , and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she ' d ask you what you wanted , you would say probably " freedom . " at which point the kgb would arrest you and send you to siberia . it ' s a good thing russia doesn ' t exist anymore . 
 [ santa voice ] ho ho ho ! why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there , when you can sit on my lap . phyllis is only . . . pretending to be a man , i ' m the real thing . sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt ! 
no it ' s not , not like penis - wise . [ as santa ] hello little boy , what ' s your name ? 
oh ! i am so sorry that phyllis hates you . and hates your body . but , santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well . 
right now ! come on over here , big boy ! there we go . [ kevin sits on his lap . it ' s a struggle ] oh my god . 
what would you like for christmas little boy ? 
what did you think was going to happen ? 
all right , just say " some toys " please . 
damn it kevin , come on . 
okay get off , get off ! [ pushes kevin off ] oh ! oh , god ! 
okay you know what you get ? you get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so santa doesn ' t have to go through this again . 
ryan come here ! 
come on , come on . 
ahhh . . . ho ho ho ! [ struggles to pull ryan towards him ] come on i need this . come over here ! 
just sit down ! 
yup . ryan and i are just having some fun ! 
whoop ! okay , what ?

do you understand , you forced my hand ? 
oh , do we ? do " we ? " is that what " we " want ? why don ' t " we " take a vote on it ? 
hey ! okay ! everybody ! the office is being pulled apart ! i realize that . there are traditions at stake . and there are - - 
no no no wait ! no ! there are other choices , there is information that we - - [ dwight counts the raised hands ] are you kidding me ? kevin ? after you almost killed me ? 
i ' ll get some punch . that looks delicious . [ shoves santa hat into punch ] 
i don ' t ask for much for christmas , i really don ' t . it ' s not like i ' m begging people to buy me diamonds and . . . broach pendants . " oh buy me something expensive or i ' m gonna kill myself . " that ' s not - i don ' t care about that . all i want to be is santa . and , you want to take that away from me ? fine . go ahead . but when you need my help because i am ruining everything , don ' t look at me . 
behold ! [ extends his arms ] jesus christ . and i bring to you glad christmas tidings . i want to remind everyone the true meaning of christmas . [ angela claps ] those of you who wish to join me , that ' s great . i ' m excited by that . and those of you who don ' t , i forgive you . but i never forget . 
oh the anti - christ ! 
oh but i can push drugs in here ? is that what you ' re saying ? 
well you have to pick one or the other . your choice . pick your poison . get back to me . in the meantime , i am going to spread my goodness all over this company ! 
 [ on karaoke microphone ] uh oh , what ' s dwight gonna get ? what is iiiit ? 
oh yes . it ' s space garbage . dwight ' s gonna be able to build himself a friend ! [ sings ] deck the halls with crappy gifts . . . 
 [ on microphone ] yeah , except for cheating on your wife . adultery ' s a sin , look it up in the bible people . what ' d you get ? 
 [ on microphone ] oh , that ' s appropriate . lot of fire where you ' re going . better get used to it . you ' re going to h - e - l - l double hockey sticks . you ' re going to hell stanley . 
 [ on microphone ] i can ' t see from here people . somebody shout it out , don ' t make me get up . 
 [ on microphone ] that ' s fantastic . you can make another dress that goes past your feet . 
 [ on microphone ] no ! 
 [ on microphone ] andy had erin . 
 [ on microphone ] what ? was i not supposed to say it ? [ jim unplugs mic ] what ? turn it back on . 
david , guess who i ' m sitting here dressed as . 
i ' ll give you a hint . his last name is christ . he has the power of flight . he can heal leopards . 
i ' m jesus , david , and you know why ? because phyllis , a woman , has uslurped my role as santa . 
what ? 
really ? what ' s going on ? 
what the hell ? how rude ! does she do that all the time ? 
hey ! get off ! get off the phone ! 
what does that mean ? 
well , can ' t alan protect you ? 
all of us ? 
oh my god . 
earlier today this office needed a santa . and then it needed a second santa . and then it needed a jesus . and now , it needs a michael . and that ' s one suit phyllis cannot fit into . 
hey . how ' s everybody doing ? 
that was a different guy . that was jesus . jesus sort of ruined the party . hurt petulant jesus . 
you know what ' s even more offensive , is baling on this party because some . . . jerk ruined the first part of it . dwight come here . here ' s my debit card , i want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room . 
i don ' t want to say . but , " it ' s fun to stay at the - " [ nods to fill in blank , but dwight doesn ' t know ] 
 " it ' s fun to stay at the - " 
 [ gestures the ymca dance ] mmm , mm mm mm . [ dwight smirks , leaves ] 
you know what , christmas isn ' t about santa , or jesus . it ' s about the workplace . all of you feel like my family . ryan , you are my son . and pam , you ' re my wife . and jim . and angela and phyllis , you are my grandmas . and stanley , you ' re our mailman . and i can ' t help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think , " how could they do this to us ? " 
it ' s not . . . nevermind . nothing . [ arguing voices ] 
i didn ' t say anything ! 
we ' re going out of business ! 
david told me on the phone . david told me . 
earlier today . 
he said , we have been sold . [ upset murmurs ] 
dwight ! jesus ! 
david ' s gone . alan ' s gone . we ' re all gone . 
it ' s hard for me to imagine a scenario , where meredith palmer keeps her job and david wallace does not - no offense meredith . 
i ' ll call him . i ' ll call david . 
yes , i will . because i always know how to get through to him . 
he told me where his kids go to school . i call the school , i tell them i ' m a pediatrician . they patch me through to his secretary . i use my little girl voice . badda bing , badda boom . 
it ' s not sweetie , it ' s michael scott . 
stephanie could you hop off please ? 
david ! 
david , you are on speakerphone with the entire branch , and the warehouse . 
david , they do not believe me . when you told me everyone was canned . 
well i think we ' re past that now . 
we ' re not fired ? 
yeah ! [ office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs ] it ' s a christmas miracle ! 
woo hoo ! [ climbs on desk , stage dives into crowd of employees ] 
oh ! you got it ? what is that ? [ dwight building his gift ] 
huh . well , maybe those will help . [ puts bag of walnuts on his desk ] 
hi santa . 
i ' d like to make a wish . 
i would like an xbox , and a tv that ' s compatible with an xbox . and , i ' m sorry . 
you called bob ? 
come on ! phyllis ! 
okay . 
oh god . get a room santas ! 
thank you santa . happy holidays . 
dunder mifflin is about to be sold . but first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch . and . . . i ' m . . . pretty nervous about it . and . . . i ' m . . . making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment . is that dishonest ? well , think of it this way : when you look in the mirror and you see your push - up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make - up and your press - on nails ; the principles that i am applying to the office are the same ones that have made lady gaga a star . . . or any number of drag queens . 
 [ entering on a segway scooter ] i see you ' ve met computron , our virtual helper . i ' m michael scott . welcome . welcome . computron is just one of the many modern devices that i have incorporated into the office . watch this . computron ? 
what is the world ' s largest ocean ? 
pacific ocean . pretty cool , huh ? 
that is fantastic . it ' s good , but it ' s not good enough . keep working . and here ' s pam . she ' s our international sales consultant . 
hello , stanley . 
ok . well , i thought i ' d show you around a little bit - 
 - since you made the trip out . and i got us reservations at cooper ' s seafood . you like lobster ? you ' ve had lobster before , right ? 
they make the best maine lobster in the world . you ' ll love it . 
no , computron , actually i think cooper ' s is the best . you ' re gonna love it . 
 [ sighs ] oh , my god . 
alright . excuse me . [ slides past eric to close the door to ryan ' s closet office before eric can see ryan in there ] if you will - 
 - follow me this way . i ' ll introduce you to the crack hr rep that you requested . i give you toby flenderson . have fun , you two . [ toby ' s chair spins around to reveal dwight filling in for toby ] 
i left a copy of best american mystery stories 1999 in toby ' s favorite stall . so , yes , i think i bought us some time . 
hey , tobes . whatcha doin ' ? whatcha guys talkin ' about ? 
stuff . i love stuff . 
hr stuff ? [ pulls up a chair ] hr pufnstuf . right up my alley . [ pointing to eric ' s notes ] what is that ? what kind of stuff is that ? 
ah . 
talkin ' bout , uh , what ? 
waste ? what does that even mean ? like garbage ? 
oh , time and resources . 
no . no . no . no . no . no . respectfully , toby , no . no . this company does not waste time or resources , ever . [ clip montage ] 
this is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive . [ to toby ] right ? would you agree with that ? 
that ' s , that is true . [ clip montage ] 
i feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth . he has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that ? what is jim capable of . . . or pam . . . or kevin ? [ clip montage over daryl ' s dunder mifflin jingle ] 
i don ' t care if he goes and files a report and says that we ' re nothing special because i think our future is very bright . we have only just begun . 
computron , i ' m gonna pull your plug . ok ? buddy ? 
just - sh - 
shut - 
shut up . shut up . 
 [ extended lazy scranton video ] sittin ' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon . called my man , dwight , just to see what was shakin ' . 
so check out how we live 
they call it scranton ! 
the electric city . scranton ! 
the electric city . lazy scranton , the electric city . they call it that ' cause of the electricity . the city ' s laid out from east to west and our public parks are libraries are truly the best . call poison control if you ' re bitten by a spider . 
plenty of space in the parking lot . 
snack attack time . 
we like cugino ' s 
they call it scranton ! 
the electric city . scranton ! 
the electric city . scranton ! 
the electric city . scranton ! 
the electric city . scranton ! 
ugh . 
oh , yeah . [ clapping and chanting ] i got a big box , yes i do . i got a big box how ' bout you ? [ points to erin ] 
it ' s from " sob - ray " , our new owner , and it is to sabre , us . i wonder what ' s inside . scissor me . [ erin tosses michael open scissors , pam is appalled ] 
dunder mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named sabre . [ mispronounced " sob - ray " ] they stepped in at the 11th hour , and they saved our asses . although david wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right , so we probably could have saved our own asses . we didn ' t need them touching our asses . 
oh ! [ rips open cardboard box ] wow . awesome . [ distributing items ] for accounting , a brand new printer . and for the sales staff , a new fax machine . this cord has creed written all over it . and whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office . thank you . 
cool . what next ? [ dwight puts his face on scanner ] 
okay , everybody , listen up . i have some bad news . due to circumstances beyond my control - 
hey , hey . i have opened a box , which should not have been opened . . . 
and distributed things which should not have been distributed . 
and - [ jim seals box with tape , rips covered with stickers ] wow . really nice job . this group of people , when they put their minds together , they can do something great . and i think that you should all be proud of yourselves . [ cell phone starts ringing from inside box ] 
alright , relax . we can do it . we just did it . so we can do this again . erin , scissor me please . [ erin tosses open scissors across jim and pam ] 
 [ fumbles ] thank you . oh ! got it . ok . 
alright , he ' s on his way up . okay . are we ready ? 
why do i have to explain everything ? 
okay . [ starts round of applause ] 
gabe seems tall . hope we get along . had a very good thing going with david wallace . he was a good guy . he was somebody i could trust . here he is . [ holding up photo of him and wallace ] you can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me . even though i was there for disciplinary reasons . 
you know what , dwight ? let ' s give him a minute to settle in , shall we ? ok ? 
hello , gabe . i am michael scott , co - manager . this is my protege , jim halpert . 
in training . 
we ' re very excited too , aren ' t we guys ? right ? 
we have a little song prepared for you . 
sabre . say - ber . sabre . 
yes , say - ber . good . take it away guys . 
saber . 
wow . really terrific . 
perfect . 
no . don ' t like that . 
mm , nope . don ' t like that . 
we ' ll still get to use the little cups , though , right ? 
i don ' t know what they ' re made of . 
you know what can ' t fit in a bottle , are the 20 little trips i take to the cooler , and the 20 little scans i do of everybody to make sure everything ' s running smoothly . and the 20 little conversations that i have with stanley . 
there is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company . but 70 percent of me is water , and the other part , the real part , the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and , if i can be crass , makes babies , that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba - 
 [ in line to fill up water bottle behind kevin and toby ] really ? you don ' t have enough water in there ? your stomach ? 
what ? 
i miss the old dunder mifflin . too much change is not a good thing . ask the climate . 
i don ' t want to appear ungrateful for everything sabre ' s doing for us . 
well , you should have a little . but it ' s great that you don ' t , because i am trying to embrace all of these changes , but i ' m - i ' ll be honest , i ' m having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of ' em . 
all of them . 
so maybe we should call . we should call someone . i could help . i ' m good with bosses . call one of the higher - ups ? 
hello . no . my name ' s michael scott . hello . 
nice to meet you . we are very excited about the merger with sabre . i think you have a great accent . 
well , i am little concerned with all of these changes , to be quite frank . i think we have done things a certain way here at dunder mifflin for quite some time , and - 
ok . i feel very strongly that you can ' t just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever . is christian slater back there ? because . . . he knows . he ' d know what to do . 
i have already told him , but i will tell him again if you think that will help . 
 [ throws aluminum bottle out of car window , breaks a windshield , speeds out of parking lot ] 
i have come here today to talk to mr . david wallace about this whole thing going on with sabre . [ rings doorbell ] he will know exactly what to do . he is not a big fan of me dropping by announced . but then again , who is ? [ loud drumming as door opens ] hey . hi , sorry . 
i hope you ' re not busy doing something . 
you sure ? 
you look great too . 
oh , yeah , that sounds good . 
hey . wow . 
really loud . 
wow . oh , yummy . [ david spreads marshmallow fluff on bread ] you have got the life , my friend . 
can i just stay here and never go back ? 
oh , man . how much time do you have ? 
yeah . 
hi . sorry , i was just in the neighborhood , thought i ' d come by , see . . . 
i don ' t know . 
sabre is changing everything . [ michael and david sitting in hot tub ] site blockers . they don ' t let us use cups . so i started thinking , who could handle this ? who would know what to do ? david wallace would know what to do . what should i do , david wallace ? 
exactly . what are you thinking ? 
it is a tough one . 
yeah . but one would be good . 
okay . 
okay . 
so the kid ' s making the noise to pick it up . 
oh , okay . 
no , i think it is - 
yep . 
the what ? 
oh , okay . 
like it . 
there are very few things that would make me not want to team up with david wallace . and suck it is one of ' em . 
see you later . [ hugs wallace ] 
bye now . 
thanks for having me . 
well , that ' s not the david wallace that i remember . [ reverses out of driveway , wallace follows him ] that is some sort of weird creature that lives in david wallace ' s house . oh , my god . alright . just get me out of here . 
hello . [ comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle ] is anybody home ? oh , thank you , erin . now if everyone would please ready their canteens , so i can fill them with the sweet , sweet nectar of gabe ' s homeland , and then propose a toast . here we go . 
you know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them ? i feel sorry for those people . that ' s the best thing ? really ? ugh . 
well , i ' m not really one for making speeches . 
but i feel pretty good right now . i really do . a lot better than i did earlier . let me tell you . 
no . this is my toast . i think this whole thing with sabre is going to work out . i have a very good feeling about it . 
here ' s my toast . orange juice is in here . and , like saber , it is from florida , and it is good . 
here ' s the toast . i ' m gonna do it now . raise your container to us and to sabre . 
mm . wow . that is metallicy . ugh . that ' s like drinking a battery . ah , really gets you in the fillings , doesn ' t it ? okay , anyway , welcome . 
hello vancouver , this is michael scott calling from the united states of america ! i have a reservation in your fair city from february 12th to the 19th , first week of the olympics . 
okey doke . 
what ? 
no . 
no . [ to hotel employee on phone ] we ' re trying to look it up right now . 
um , come on . 
well , i have been booked for three years , so you should have that . i ' ve always heard that british columbia is a very nice place , but i am not getting that from this conversation . 
oh . 
that ' s it ! 
alright , i would like to cancel my reservation , please . 
okay , put it on my card . 
today , jo bennett , the ceo from sabre , is coming to see us here for the first time . she bought us sight unseen , like a mail - order bride , so she ' s gotta be kinda nervous . i mean , are we ugly ? are we smart ? are we cool ? are we too cool ? do we speak english ? 
 [ jo bennett enters with two humongous dogs , everyone stands to welcome her except dwight ] why hello ! 
pleasure to meet you , miss bennett . 
jo , i don ' t know how things work in florida , which from your description sounds like a colorful , lawless swamp , but here it takes two men to do one job , where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job . 
whoa , whoa ! 
and sometimes i can hardly handle that ! 
forget the question . . . 
i humbly accept the management position . 
because , well , jim . where i ' m from , two types of folk : those who ain ' t , and those who are knee - high on a grasshopper . which type ain ' t you ain ' t ? ya ' ll come back now . 
yes . 
no , we know . texas ! 
i could manage my way around that . 
i will try to manage my excitement ! 
i have been saying the word " manager " a lot , so whenever jo thinks " manager " she thinks of me . camel cigarettes did the same thing with joe camel by making him look like a penis . i can ' t even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis . and vise - versa . 
sure . you here to tell me that you think i would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk ? 
what ? 
what ? really ? 
wow ! 
la la la , hello oscar ! 
what are you reading ? 
oh , that is my favorite ocean ! i love it ! i am so happy right now . no ! i can ' t keep it a secret any longer . jim is stepping down to salesman , i am going to be the sole manager once again . 
why , is there an untapped gay market ? 
 . . . where did you get that information . 
manuel who ? 
well , according to the manual , there is no cap on commissions . i have been hustled . 
son of a bitch . [ enters conference room ] pardon me . 
okay . 
really ? aw , that is so sweet of you ! but , i cannot accept , because i have been thinking about it , and i think i wanna go back to sales . 
yeah . you can take the man out of the salesman , but you can ' t take the sales out of salesman . 
no , i think i would be bad . i would sleep in my office , and i would sexually harass people . 
i ' m turning myself in right now ! 
thank you . 
great ! that ' s great . congratulations . have fun signing my commission checks , boss . 
how is that possible ? 
no excuses erin , come on ! make it happen . 
oh , yeah . fine , fine . leave it here . i have to make some sales anyway . who should i call with my magic sales fingers ? [ michael ' s phone rings ] michael scott , head of sales . 
 [ on phone ] it will be a pleasure doing business with you . thanks , bye . [ hangs up phone , blows train whistle ] i just got a new account for the gentleman ' s club in carbondale . it is called " curves . " i went by there the other day , saw some of the women walking in . not really my cup of tea . actually , kevin , you might like it ! 
why not ? it ' s part of the sales experience . 
well , okay . . . 
what is that smell ? do you smell that ? what is that ? like a sulfur deposit under here ? 
no , i ' m serious , we don ' t have to put up . . . is it the dogs ? 
you know what , we don ' t have to deal with this . i am going to google sulfur maps . 
no , this is geological . 
are you kidding me ? 
and you guys are okay with this ? 
oh my god . 
hey . 
you know , it ' s funny . i used to stand in here and wish i was out there . now i ' m out there , and i wish i was in here . 
yeah . except there ' s no grass out there . it ' s just a farty dirt patch . 
i really need my job back . we made a terrible mistake here . 
we make a poster that says " happy opposite day ! " and she sees it on the way out . . . nah , that ' s stupid . ugh ! i wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from men in black . 
lethal weapon ? 
what ? what i ' m saying . . . 
and weirdly i ' m a good dog person , right guys ? [ dogs go to him ] see ? they love me . 
alright ! 
oh , it smells good in here . 
erin , what about my keyboard ? [ erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard , playing a beat ] aw , so good to be home . how about a little bosa nova ? 
oh , oh , oh ! contraption ! she ' s contrapting ! okay , you know what ? i think i should drive you guys to the hospital , and here is why . i am a licensed , classy driver in the state of pennsylvania . i gassed up the car . . . 
actually , i put diesel in this time , trying to save some money . 
happy to do it . also , i did a heck of a job baby - proofing this office .

distractions are good ! that means conference room , five minutes ! no , no , five seconds ! right now , right now ! conference room ! topic , potpourri ! let ' s go ! 
um , i am sort of a master of distraction . when i was a kid , my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class . try to think , what were the first thirteen colonies ? mm - hmm , mm - hmm . [ michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises . ] 
the purpose for this meeting is to take pam ' s mind off of what ' s going on inside of her body . 
i will allow that . 
okay . 
does anybody have anything ? anything interesting , any hobbies , uh , special skills ? 
yes , phyl ? 
 [ as pam shakes her head ] nope , nope , i don ' t think anybody wants to see that . 
 [ as pam gives the thumbs up ] that sounds good ! do you need some music , or . . . ? okay . 
 [ as pam has another contraction ] where are we ? we have every six minutes , ladies and gentlemen . another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there . 
yeah , happy times . come on . let ' s have happy times . 
jim , as a matter of fact , i have printed out ten ways to induce labor . and i ' m thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor . erin , read the first one . 
okay , nobody touch pam ' s nipples . think of pam ' s nipples as toby ' s grundle . 
okay , yeah , why don ' t you go get it ? 
okay , the opposite of that ? 
ooh , someone ' s freakin ' . 
i think he is . 
pam , pam ! okay , alright , okay , it ' s time . time to go to the hospital . somebody get jim , please ! is it midnight yet ?

what would you say , if i told you that i was about to change your life ? 
i would like you to meet your new boyfriend . 
okay , hold on . whoa , whoa , whoa . you got to let the cookies cool before you pop ' em in your mouth . why don ' t you guys get to know each other ? maybe have lunch together ? 
good ! 
sure . kevin , please leave . 
bye . 
okay . this is going to kill kevin . 
i ' m not so sure . kevin has an enormous heart . literally , he has an elephant heart . he had a transplant when he was seventeen . had some problems , blah blah blah . 
no , kevin doesn ' t have an elephant heart . but he is very sensitive . and it won ' t kill erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like i promised him . . . i bet his heart is enlarged , though . 
just don ' t let him sit on you . . . i ' m kidding . you ' ll have fun . it ' ll be good . it ' ll be good . there he is . go to him . 
kevin . erin would like a few words with you . 
oh , my god , this is agonizing . look , kevin , do you really think that you could have dated erin ? 
okay , even if someone told you that , you should know that that could never be possible , kevin . and i ' m surprised that you didn ' t question me in the first place . 
no . 
lynn was as hot as erin . 
this isn ' t about me , and that is debatable . and i have a personality , where as you . . . yes , andy ? 
kev . . . nice . going . 
 [ smoking a cigar ] there is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles , and find true love . and that is what i thought that erin and kevin were going to find today . . . i think i ' m going to be sick . . . 
hello hello . top of the morning to you ! ooh ooh ! green m & amp ; ms ! nature ' s viagra ! [ grabs and pours kevin - esque scoop of m & amp ; ms into his coat pocket ] two of my favorite joke areas combined . it ' ll be a good day . 
it is st . patrick ' s day , and here in scranton that is a huge deal . it is the closest that the irish will ever get to christmas . 
morning , honey - pile . 
it is . this is a little something for you to remember your time here in scranton by . 
yes it is ! 
no , no no - that is a good gift actually . buildings here in scranton are literally powered by coal . 
mm , that sounds great , actually . 
when you work for sabre , only one thing matters . and i don ' t care if you ' re a loser , or you practice bestiality , if jo likes you , you are in . and i am in ! 
that is a great idea jb . 
oscar , homosexual accountant . 
daryl . mellow , soulful , smart for warehouse . . . 
okay . 
look at that picture that you drew . nice job ! we ' re very proud of you . you know what , we ' re gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen . 
oh no ! say it ' s not so , jo , we ' re gonna miss you , we ' re gonna miss you so much ! 
well , i am heading down there . 
how about july 4th weekend ? [ reveals paper ticket ] 
i did ! 
you know what , in the spirit of full disclosure , i have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights , but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left , so i think we should pull the trigger and - 
all right , everybody , just try to put a brave face on . 
let ' s follow the chain of events . jo likes michael . jo invites michael to house . jo doesn ' t like michael anymore . hmmm . 
hello . i want you to stop what you ' re doing right now . you are stressed , and i ' m taking you to lunch . 
no is not an option . 
all right . well if you need me , i ' ll be on the other side of that wall . knock once for yes , twice for no . 
 [ laughs ] i ' ll be over there . 
very nice . 
a real hoop dreams story you got there . oh man , you seem to have caught jo ' s eye . how ' d you make that happen ? 
hm mm . seriously , how did you do it ? 
how do i put this delicately ? does her family owe your family something , in terms of a past injustice ? 
okay . all right . 
hey there . so i think i ' m done . gonna head out . unless you want to chat . like we were doing earlier . 
mm ? well , the clock says chatting time , so . 
right . what ? 
mm . mm . oh well . 
no , no , no . that ' s super - clear - ish . [ exits , closes door , takes off coat . ] nope . nope . nope . nope . 
hey pack - man . 
how you doing stud ? you already there ? 
how ' s the lady situation ? 
ah damn . that sounds great . unfortunately i am stuck here , because my boss is making us work late . 
yeah . maybe next year . 
how late do we have to work tonight ? 
why does she do that ? why doesn ' t she just tell you what your schedule is ? 
do i really want to turn out like gabe ? twenty - six . single . tied to my desk . no life , no family . i want to have been married by the time i would ' ve turned thirty . that ' s just - that ' s just depressing . 
hello jo . 
there is , as a matter of fact . it ' s getting sorta late . it ' s 8 : 30 . and it ' s st . patrick ' s day , which is a world ethnic holiday . so i have decided i ' m going to dismiss my employees . 
i ' m thrilled with the work they ' ve done today , both quality and the quantity . great performance , very , very solid all the way around . 
okay . happy st . patrick ' s day . [ starts to leave office ] and also , i would like to say that i will be canceling my trip down to tallahassee . although i do look forward to our professional relationship . 
yes . 
excuse me , excuse me . hey guys ! 
drinks are on me ! 
oh - hoh ! all right . 
did i mess up my career today ? my future prospects at sabre ? i don ' t know . there is a chance . yes . i tell you i love my job . but jo wants me to put on a show for her , and pretend to work late ? nah . i spent all day , trying to make her like me , and i forgot to ask myself something : do i even like her ? as the irish poet bobby mcferrin says , " don ' t worry , be happy . " 
okay . okay , all right . best night ever . [ meredith joins behind packer ] what the hell is going on back there ? 
hey jim , jim . come here . [ holds up photo ] do you know who that is ? 
look at him . look at him - t - shirt , jeans . . . 
 [ laughs ] i am flattered . that ' s johnny depp . 
in my condo complex . 
i am flipping out , man . i mean , you remember my idea for the fourth pirates movie . 
 [ feigning accent ] hey , jim , jim - where , where do i find the black pearl ? 
captain jack sparrow . captain jack sparrow , jim . 
no . i ' m captain jack sparrow . 
okay , okay . screw you , halpert . you know , it ' s not easy getting excited about stuff . remember how you felt when you thought you ' d seen roger clemens ? 
yeah . well , it wasn ' t him . 
i know , i know . 
i know ! it also explains why the name on his mailbox was m shulman . 
 [ speaking at a staff meeting ] first up , the lost and found has gone missing . it itself is lost , so please , try not to lose anything until we find it . ah , pet day . if you don ' t have a pet , please don ' t feel like - 
ah , yes , the leads . the leads that sabre has spent $ 50 , 000 to get from a market research company . . . are not here yet . but will be . . [ muttering , people rise to leave ] no , no , meeting ' s not over . 
no sales topic per se . 
dwight ? 
i would like your undivided attention , please . 
over the last few weeks , things have been changing here . sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads . i think it ' s kind of screwed up , because the way this place used to work was : make friends first , make sales second , make love third , in no particular order . 
yeah . 
m - hmm . 
is that all you have to say to me ? 
wow , wowie wowie . congratulations . it ' s a big cheque . [ jim stands in corner , texting ] 
stop sexting pam . i ' m trying to congratulate you . 
you writing your memoirs over there ? 
well , it ' s a pretty big check . 
okay . don ' t gloat . here ' s the thing . this kind of money can corrupt people . 
i ' m just saying , that - 
honey and jelly sandwich time . [ removes lunch from fridge ] 
oh , you got to be kidding me . [ holds up squashed sandwich ] look at that . that ' s - 
you saw who did this and you didn ' t stop them ? 
the sales department smashed my sandwich . 
you don ' t get it . 
that ' s what she said . 
yeah . 
thank you very much . 
ah , just the stupid leads . 
alright . then i guess i should give them out . hold on . you know what i ' m thinking ? i ' m thinking that i have something that you want . you guys are acting like you own this place . and you don ' t . not even sabre owns this place . it ' s a rental . i ' m kind of sick of the attitude around here . i ' m sick of the cocky walk , i am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face , i am sick of your uppity attitude , jim . . . i think i am not going to give these to you . [ angela , kevin and oscar applaud ] 
then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour . okay . just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone , you got an ice - cream cone . if that were the case , then in the summertime , everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice - cream cone . 
they act like i have no power . 
thank you . 
hmm . well , if that is what i am required to do , i will do exactly that . 
exactly that . 
exactly that . 
hello . may i have everyone ' s attention , please ? gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads , so i ' m going to give the leads to . . . king creed ! [ hands him a lead ] 
 - and to king meredith ! [ hands her a lead ] 
and to king angela ! [ hands her a lead ] because today we are all kings . and queens [ pats oscar ' s shoulder ] . 
i ' m giving them the leads , phyllis . 
hey . 
mm - hmm . 
okay . [ passes jim some index cards ] 
alright . 
oh , right , those are clues . and within each clue is a lesson . you learn a lesson , and then you find a lead . the leads are scattered all over the industrial park . i am trying to make your kids respect you . because a father needs to respect his boss , and kids don ' t respect the father who doesn ' t respect the boss . do you understand that line of logic ? 
i do understand it . 
or is it ? 
today i turned an office crisis into a teachable moment . [ cuts to jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of ravioli ] a lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [ clue next to jim reads : ' now that ' s italian ! ' ] some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead , learn nothing [ cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues ] some people shouldn ' t be in this business . 
well , bigshot , ' if you want to find your leads , go to the man who never breathes ' . 
wait . what day is today ? 
oh my god . oh my god [ takes off running ] oh my god , no , no no , hey , hey [ chases after garbage van ] wait , wait ! 
okay . you know what , let ' s just go to the dump , start looking - ryan , c ' mon , shotgun in my car - 
why ? because i am not going to call sabre and say , ' hi , you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today ? well , because of a screw - up by a staff member , they ' re now in the city dump . " 
well , that ' s not the way it ' s going t sound . here ' s what we ' re going to do . we ' ll go to the dump , we ' ll look around , then we ' ll all go out and get pizza , maybe catch a movie , late - night drink , some more pizza , call it a night . what do you - 
really ? 
okay , no , you encouraged it . you were complicit [ looks to jim for vocab - reassurance ] complicit . you were all successories ! 
you can . 
okay fine , i get it . i ' ll just go by myself . 
you know , dwight , there was a time when you ' d be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me . 
yeah . sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn . if you don ' t believe me , look in my gutters . 
 [ kicking through rubbish at the dump ] you ' ve changed , man . 
since when do you care about money ? when i first met you , you were a wide - eyed innocent . 
no , i ' m talking about your personality , dwight . 
assistant to the managed him - 
yeah . 
you think you would have done better without me ? really ? 
wow . ohhhkay . man . when i think about all the time i wasted being your friend - i shouldn ' t have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - 
you know what , i should have been doing ? i should have been out at bars , finding my soul - mate , finding my wife , making babies - 
that ' s my wife you ' re talking about , man . 
if i wanted to hit you , i would have hit you . 
no no . you just made an enemy with the wrong guy , dwight . [ they throw volleys of rubbish at each other ] no , time out , time out . [ michael inspects a box , then hurls it at dwight ] time in ! 
don ' t even think about that [ dwight begins rolling it towards michael , as he reaches him dwight kicks it and falls backward . the spool comes to a halt in front of michael , and michael pushes it towards dwight . ] 
okay , dwight . here we go [ picks up a sink , spills dump juice on his pants ] oh god . 
we ' re never going to find those leads , are we ? [ they both sit on the edge of a claw - footed bathtub ] 
this [ picks up racquet ] why would somebody throw that out ? 
yeah , she does - she loves purple . [ dwight sniffs it ] does it stink ? 
know what would be a great picture here ? just this whole dump , and in the middle , one flower . that ' s it . and the caption would read : 
in the dump . 
no ! better ! 
how many is that ? 
count the last one . 
oh , new record ! 
oh , what did you do today ? 
oh , yeah , sitting on your big fat butt . alright , that is the number to beat . 
my respect . [ everyone returns to work ] okay , i ' ll make it a little more interesting . anyone who does more than 25 push - ups - 
gets to go home . [ everyone starts to do push - ups ] ooh ! i say ' dance , ' they say ' how high ? ' here we go . oh , no . no , no , no . butt to high . [ steps on angela ] disqualified ! 
what do we got ? creed , disqualified . 
 [ stanley straining and breathing heavily ] oh , wow , that is adorable ! 
yeah , i ' m betting one more . 
good . 
alright , alright . [ chanting continues ] 
well , it ' s not exactly fair . he ' s got all of his weight that ' s helping him go down . 
yes ? 
ladies and gentleman , it is quitting time . 
ok , yes . sure . 
no , i got that . 
i am in . 
it ' s a deal . 
oh , wow , i cannot believe this is happening . this is everything i dreamed . oh , my god ! [ laughs ] 
it ' s not a birthday , it ' s not a good - bye party . . . 
sucks to be you . 
that would be sublime . 
yes . 
hello , how are you ? 
what is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for ? [ julie laughs ] 
oh , no , no . pam and jim work for me . and if they win , they are fired . 
no . no , not really . not really , but they better not win . 
so , what do you do ? 
really ? 
see , i didn ' t think you could teach that . i thought that was something you were born with . what am i thinking right now ? 
yes . i feel like an idiot . awesome . 
about what ? 
she ' s nice . 
yeah . 
uh , yeah , sure . 
about what ? 
 [ removing tie ] well , apparently , michael scott is on a date . and that , that my friend , changes everything . [ puts on backwards golf cap ] 
guys , come on , i ' m on a date . let me do my thang . 
hi , i ' m date mike . nice to meet me . how do you like your eggs in the morning ? [ tries to wink ] 
hey , guys , guys , guys . [ steals a cherry from waitress passing buy ] watch this . ready ? 
i ' m tying a knot in the stem with my tongue . 
 [ choking ] wow . oh , wow , that was close . 
i would say i kind of have an unfair advantage because i watch reality dating shows like a hawk , and i learn . i absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers . actually , i probably learn more from the losers . 
hello . 
hi . 
yeah , why don ' t you send the bill to 23 i don ' t care lane , scranton , pennsylvania ? 
hey , she can tell i ' m on a date , right ? right ? i ' m just having fun . 
really ? you told on me . that ' s lame . 
yes . homelessness . what ? 
where ? 
okay , all right . okay , whoa . i ' m just kidding around . i ' m sorry . 
she can ' t talk to us that way . 
you let somebody talk to you like that , where does it stop ? 
well , i am starting it again ! 
hey , you embarrassed my friends in front of me and i ' m gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize . 
i am here with my employees . i am here on a date . hello . 
well , it just so happens that i am a manager too . and the way i manage people is that i touch their hearts and souls with humor , with love and maybe a dash of razzle - dazzle . and i don ' t see that from you . 
yes it is . i am writing a book about it . 
i ' ve written all of it . . . in my head . 
if you ' re really interested , it ' s called ' somehow i manage ' and there ' s going to be a picture of me on the cover , shrugging , with my sleeves rolled up . 
read it ? i own it . but no , i have not read it . 
i own a chrysler . 
no , you shut up . 
grenadine . 
i manage a paper company - dunder mifflin / sabre . 
i did . i actually put it in your bowl . 
no , no . 
no , it ' s michael scott . 
he is i . 
oh , hey guys . [ thumbs up ] 
hey , julie ! you having fun ? [ julie leaves ] 
halperts , wait up . oh , what a great night . got to hang out with my peeps . sort of did okay with a new young lady . 
i think i did . but i can ' t take all of the credit . some of the credit is due , in fact , to my good friend , date mike . nice to meet me . 
i ' m going to give erin $ 15 . 
a one - on - one lunch with erin ? 
she ' s kind of a rube . 
okay . all right . all right . okay . i ' ll take her to lunch . 
 [ walks over to erin ' s desk ] hi , erin . happy secretary ' s day . 
i wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because i was hoping to ask you to . . . [ erin snaps a picture of michael ] lunch . 
ugh . 
well , hayworth ' s is more business casual , and they always screw up your order . so i ' m . . . 
okay , well , we ' ll figure something . [ michael turns and starts back toward his office ] 
 [ looks at andy who is urging he agree with her , michael turns around ] okay , let ' s go to hayworth ' s . 
all right . 
 [ in his car with erin driving to lunch ] would you mind if i listen to my book on tape ? i ' m kind of a bookworm . this is the novelization of the movie precious based on the book push by sapphire . 
 [ shakes head , annoyed ] i don ' t know . 
ahhh . 
right . [ sighs ] 
an age or month ? 
i ' ve been trying . i ' ve been trying to keep it going . erin is just weird . 
so how are things going with andy ? 
well , let ' s see . um . . . andy . plays the banjo . 
other than the fact that he dated angela , i don ' t think he is a snappy dresser . 
i don ' t think he is the best dresser . reminds me of easter . 
mm - hmm . you didn ' t know that ? oh . 
okay . 
i don ' t know . probably didn ' t want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else . 
they were engaged , so . . . [ erin looks shocked ] okay , you know what , sir ? 
yeah , i asked for pickles with my burger . and there are only , like five or six . could i get some more pickles ? 
thank you . 
mm - hmm . yeah . 
well . . . 
what are you doing ? what are you doing ? 
okay , okay . you know what ? you know what ? you know what ? everybody ' s looking at you right now . 
 [ turns to other restaurant patrons ] i ' ll have what she ' s having ! 
 [ in michael ' s car ] did you have a . . . did you like your lunch ? did you have a good lunch ? did you like that ? did you enjoy your food ? it was good . i liked my lunch . 
you know what , i think we can all agree that angela ' s not so great , so . . 
no . no . no . 
stop talking . 
oh god . 
andy , she ' s not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with . all right ? and besides , who doesn ' t tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them ? that ' s like . . that ' s like mr . and mrs . smith crap . 
you know what , i resent the implication that i would keep that secret . everyone here knows that i can ' t and won ' t keep a secret . 
erin ? 
no , no , i was just watching cookie monster . it finally downloaded . mind if i sit down ? 
oh . yep . i ' m sorry about that . i feel . . . i ' m sorry i caused that thing . 
well , yeah , yes . but i still feel sorry . you know what , i wouldn ' t worry about angela . she doesn ' t hold a candle to you , erin . she ' s old enough to be your mom for one thing . and she ' s , like , three feet tall . and she wears pioneer women clothing . and i don ' t think she ' s ever pooped in her life . and andy , you know , come on . andy , his butt looks big in those khakis . 
you said butt . 
ahh ! you said it ! you know who you would love ? oh , this guy in my neighborhood , tom dizemore . this is him : " hey ! hey scott ! " 
 [ walking up ] oh , oh , i was just watching that . did you do that , man ? " oscar . i am the count . " nailed him . nailed him . [ gives kevin a fist pump ] good work cookie monster . 
buenos dias , erin . 
no , no , no , no . solamente en espanol , por favor . 
i believe that every man , woman , and child in this country should learn how to speak spanish . they are our neighbors to the south , and this would be a healing thing for . . . for all of north america . and . . . i am going on vacation next week to cancun . 
buenos dias , jaime . 
ha ha ! buenos dias , dwight ! 
la telefona . 
 [ clears throat ] oh . eso es lo que dice , el ! 
damn it . [ knock on door ] ah , angelo . 
yo soy cancun . 
can you smell the power of the halperts ? power couple . 
i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company . 
did somebody order a hooker over here ? 
hi . how are you ? 
there ' s this woman i met a few weeks ago . her name is donna , the manager of sid & amp ; dexter ' s and , right now , we ' re in the midst of a passionate love affair . um , no . but she is coming by today . maybe to buy some printers , so . . . 
right here , we have the wonder twins , jim and pam halpert . they will be assisting you today . 
 [ barges in ] hi . 
sorry to interrupt . sorry to interrupt . do you , donna , by any chance shop at victoria ' s secret ? 
because i keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me . 
uh , yes , uh , the sale is on now through may . 
okay , i have more of them . 
i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier , and i want to show you . . . there we go ! [ michael ' s picture pops up on the powerpoint screen ] whoa , look at those vivid colors . look at my eyes . those are shrek - green eyes . that is me again . i think this displays the crisp , dazzling white . 
and that would be a display [ image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up ] of the crisp , gorgeous black . 
it ' s subtle . that ' s how it works . i show her an image that turns her on . and then she looks at me , then back at me , then back at the image . soon , she doesn ' t know what is me , what is the image . she just knows that she ' s turned on . 
this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts . i ' ve never taken anybody there before . 
ryan . 
and that ' s it . that ' s me . that ' s who i am . 
oh , thanks . [ softly ] you ' re not bad , either . 
hmm . 
jim ! could you come in here for a sec ? what was that printer we were looking at ? 
 [ in his office ] you didn ' t see it , pam . she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move . shortbread ? 
oh really , jim ? what about pam ? and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss . maybe this could be my pam . 
look , i know that i screwed up in there . i know that i probably messed up your sale . i just want to go in and fix it . 
so maybe we could find a little wiggle room , right ? 
maybe wee find some wiggle room ? 
i think we could . [ donna giggles ] 
okay , well sometimes . . . sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money , right ? like for tax purposes . 
why don ' t you run them again ? 
if she is , it ' s working . 
so corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller . . . 
operating blahdy blahdy blah . boilerplate . pound of fish . [ donna laughing ] just kidding . do you like mints ? 
i carry mints with me sometimes . you ever tried those ? 
they ' re good [ donna grabs mint ] 
sure . 
i can ' t stop myself from kissing her . 
okay , guys , guys , guys . just tell me it ' s not totally insane to try one more time . 
okay . what do you think ? 
andy ? 
okay , some for , some against . 
pam ? 
what do you think ? 
i ' m going with pam ' s group . 
here we go . 
okay . 
no , guys , guys , guys . guys , just . . . thank you for talking . wish me luck . 
what sort of movie would rudy have been if he had just stopped , given up , after two rejections ? would have been a lot shorter . probably been a lot funnier . but it would have ultimately been a disappointment . i still would have seen it , but that ' s not . . . the point . 
we should have your contract done by thursday . 
okay . 
yeah it was nice to do business with you , too . 
i don ' t know . i think so . 
 [ whispers ] okay . so . . . oh , donna ? 
thank you so much . 
mmm . [ donna giggles ] 
 [ follows her out of office ] ahem . so , um . . . okay , if you have . . . if there ' s any other questions that you have . . . 
all right . all right . bye . 
and have a good elevator ride . 
oh , what ' s that out there ? 
i don ' t know . i don ' t know . can ' t really trust my feelings anymore . 
she suckered you too . 
was it the cleavage ? 
yep . 
god . she left this here ? 
okay . maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work . 
yeah . this could be a signal . people don ' t just take barrettes off . 
 [ hold up barrette ] well . . . 
yeah , i know . i know . 
i know . you ' re right . thank you . thanks everybody . [ waves , returns to his office , clears throat , turns around and runs out of office ] 
 [ runs down to parking lot , sighs ] 
oh . you ' re still here . i have your baguette . 
you know what ? everybody told me that you weren ' t interested . everybody . and i didn ' t believe ' em . and they were right . so . . . there ' s your barrette . 
who ? 
about what ? 
no , no . no . 
no . . . [ they kiss again ] 
 [ returns to office ] what happened ? 
really ? ! oh , that ' s great . that ' s such good news . i did it ! [ all look at him ] i kissed . we kissed . 
no , i ' m serious . it . . . this happened . i went down to the parking lot and i was . . . i returned her barrette [ holds up barrette ] we ki . . . we did . okay . we did . we did . 
you know what ? it doesn ' t matter . because i know it happened . and that is all that counts . [ shouts ] i did do it ! 
jim . are you clicking a detonator ? 
get back to work , dwight . please . 
ooh ! things with donna are so . . . oh - ho - ho ! they ' re going great . i , uh . . . we ' re just clicking on every level . emotionally and sexually and . . . orally and i am not used to relationships going this well . i ' m actually having trouble focusing on my job . and i like it ! 
who enjoys the weekends ? [ all raise hands ] of course . now the weekend is always great if you have someone , which i do . i have donna . she is hot . she has a pilates butt . but we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex . did i say that ? yes , i did . [ all nod ] and the reason you are here is that i need ideas for things that donna and i could do on the weekend . so just shout it out . 
okay . 
okay , you get out of here , big dog . [ high - fives stanley ] ah , no , no , no , no . you guys sit down . i need ideas . 
yeah , well , stanley doesn ' t help with anything . come on . shout ' em out , shout ' em out . 
oh ! 
that ' s fun . 
all right . 
we actually went to the poconos last tuesday . we headed up there , we went to a little chinese bistro , um , p . f . chang ' s . 
because when your super - hot girlfriend says , " i wanna go to mount pocono , " you go to mount pocono and you do her . and we screwed . whoops . tmi . 
you know what , kelly ? this is the real world . not the real world : scranton . oh my god , this is super weird . when ryan had two girlfriends , he used to take me to some diner in hazelton just so the other girl wouldn ' t see . 
you guys think donna ' s cheating on me ? 
 . . . and . . . we had sex , too . 
how ? 
how do i not make any more of it ? 
all right . [ all stand up to leave ] and she won ' t say , " i love you . " 
nine dates . i said it on the second date . 
yeah , she does all that . 
no , no . . . 
run what ? 
why didn ' t you just say that , pam ? 
well , that ' s easy for you to say . you have a bad imagination . it ' s stupid . i live in a fantasy world . 
yes , jim , i do . and i can ' t stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit . 
that ' s what makes it so wrong . 
ever since i found out that donna might be cheating on me , i have not eaten or slept . this not knowing , that ' s what ' s killing me . 
 [ whispers ] i want someone to follow donna . i want her tailed . i need the name of a good private investigator . 
this is you . how much do you charge ? 
i ' ll give you $ 50 . money ' s no object . 
okay . 
it ' s never too early for ice cream , jim . but we didn ' t have any ice cream , so this is mayonnaise and black olives . 
it ' s comfort food , all right ? [ disgustedly ] god . 
i know . well , i hope you ' re right . we ' ll see what dwight says . 
because i have him investigating her . i ' m waiting for a text update . 
it ' s too late to undo it . i need to know . otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok . 
god , this is so disgusting . 
i know . 
that ' s not true . [ pam stares him down ] you ' re right , i ruin everything . and i ' ve known some wonderful women . holly , carol , jan . 
helene ? 
oh . 
oh , yeah . yes , yes . yes . all of , all of the greatest loves of my life . 
 [ sighs ] all right . [ calls dwight ] 
you ' re back . what happened ? 
no , what happened with donna ? 
ugh ! 
no . no ! are you sure ? 
who eats eight protein bars ? 
okay . well , i am just glad this is all over . 
what ? no , she didn ' t say that . 
i am not paying for that membership . 
 [ sitting on the floor behind erin ' s desk , sighs ] ohhh . . . mmm . . . 
no , i like the attention . is she here yet ? 
that ' s her ? 
mm - hmm . right . right . right . [ michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as donna approaches ] okay , i ' ll talk to you later . 
i didn ' t . everybody else here did . everybody convinced me that something was up . they poisoned my mind . 
ye . . . pfff . well , no . it ' s a lie . that ' s not what happened . i just like you . i can ' t believe i get to be with you . you work at an adult arcade . you could have any man you want . 
if you wanna dump me , i totally get it . 
well , you are boner - ific . [ donna laughs ] 
 . . . poop my pants . 
oh , my god , vero beach . no . is that on the water ? 
we are ? 
wow . [ pam knocks on michaels door and goes in ] that ' s exciting . 
hey . 
well it can wait . it can wait . 
jim is her husband . 
and they are having problems , so sh . . . 
good in bed . 
oh , my god . look at how cheap street level rooms are . am i the only person who enjoys people watching ? 
okay , weirdo . 
yeah , i just remembered that i have to go to the bathroom . pam ? 
who the hell is this ? who is this guy ? 
god ! lowest of the low . that guy . just a notch above toby . you know what ? 
i ' m gonna kill him . no , i ' m not . i feel . . . i . . . no , i ' m not going to kill him . 
i have to hear it from her . 
i need to have her tell me herself . right ? 
i need to have her say . . . 
i need to say , " what the hell is that ? what the hell is that ? " 
no , god ! no , no , oh , my god ! 
 [ calms down ] okay . okay . okay . 
you know what ? we should really do something fun this week . 
wouldn ' t that be fun ? 
how about thursday ? 
i can ' t do thursday . book club . how about friday ? 
oh , really ? ' cause i was thinking we could go to this concert . spice girls are opening for weird al . front row . it ' d be a great , great concert . 
oh okay . well , maybe i could stop by . 
nope , that ' s tuesday . 
you ' re cheating . you ' re cheating on me . 
pam told me . [ looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does donna ; jim , dwight , and pam are visible on conference room window , they all scramble as soon as donna and michael look up , pam throwing herself on the floor ] 
who is he ? 
the other man . who ' s the guy ? who is it ? 
i ' m the mistress ? 
toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere , like he owns the place . the first time i threw mine away , i thought it was an ant trap . [ finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office ] but i figured i ' d rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc . [ throws it away ] the second time . . . i thought it was one of those , you know , those things you turn over and it moos . [ finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet ] like a cow thing . but upon closer examination , it was another ant trap , so i threw it away . and the third time . . . i did it out of spite . [ takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can ] 
pfffffttt . 
you ' re kidding me ? god ! you say radon is silent , but deadly , and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth ? what is this ? 
you know what ? we ' re not gonna die of radon , we ' re gonna die of boredom . 
right ? and if i had a gun with two bullets and i was in a room with hitler , bin laden , and toby , i would shoot toby twice . 
okay , alright . 
i would kill bin laden and then toby . 
okay geniuses , how would you do it ? 
i don ' t know . 
yes , we stab toby through the heart with an icicle . 
 [ shouting ] toby , just do it ! god ! 
good work . [ clapping ] 
 [ walks in ] morning everyone . 
hello ! 
oh , thank you . it ' s reversible , i think . [ everyone laughs ] 
oh ! oh wow , are those eagles ' flavors ? cake it to the limit . that ' s my favorite ! i love that ! too much for me to have by myself . anybody wanna share ? 
okay . well . . . that ' s random . i will dig into those later . 
no , i gotta go . text me later . 
hey . 
oh , hooters to go . nice . 
that . . . exists ? 
okay , well , i ' ll have to take a rain check , but thanks for the offer . 
okay , pam . . . she ' s not invisible so stop asking silly questions . 
since when is this an office where we delve into each other ' s personal lives ? 
i like donna . is it wrong to keep seeing her ? depends on who you ask . i mean , if you ask her husband . . . or you took a random poll , yeah , it ' s wrong . 
well , i think we all know what you ' re capable of meredith . 
people , this is scranton . and many people consider that to be the paris of northeastern pennsylvania . and in paris , it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers . 
i will have you know that i asked donna about this and she is fine with it . and just to be sure , i asked her again afterward . same answer . 
he is never gonna find out . he is a high school baseball coach . he wakes up early . he goes to bed early . look at how long it took for him to find out . [ points to andy ] it was right under his nose . i had to tell him . 
i ' m sorry , it . . . why is it okay for stanley to cheat or for phyllis to cheat . . . 
on her diet ! he ' s a sports guy . he ' s scummy . dogfighting . drugs . they spit . 
real sports with bryant gumble . 
you know what ? you know what ? i am declaring a moment of silence right now . ten minutes of silence honoring michael jackson . just sit there and think about michael jackson . 
mm , no , when are you people going to stop casting the first stone ? i am not in the wrong here . i am the good guy . 
do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy ? do you think he ' s an angel ? i don ' t think so . why is his wife going off and having a little something - something with me ? there has to be a problem with him . 
i am beyonce always . 
yes , i am . 
i would love that . 
i have work to do . 
let ' s go . [ starts walking towards the elevator ] i can ' t wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife . i should punch him in the nose for what he ' s making me do to her . 
all right , andy , please . 
shh ! try not to draw attention , please . that ' s him . that ' s him . 
right there . the coach ! 
right there . look , look . follow my finger . okay ? see ? the grownup by the base ? 
all right . can you just - - can you just act normal for a second , please ? 
you have no idea what you ' re talking about . 
you don ' t . no , no . 
you don ' t know . you don ' t - - you don ' t know anything . look at him . look at him over there . high - fiving ? he didn ' t even do anything . kid did all the work . i bet he does that at home . i bet it ' s like , " hey , donna , why don ' t you wash the dishes ? " " high - five , donna . " " hey , why don ' t you bring me my slippers ? " " hi - five . i ' m taking all the credit . " 
okay , well , that ' s because he ' s paying their salary . 
i know , i know , i know . it - - i ' m - - it - - that was a euphemism . 
shh ! okay , all right . don ' t , don ' t . 
 [ whispers ] okay . 
no . god . you go talk to him . 
no , no , no . 
i ' m good . oh , my god . 
sorry . i got some stomach cramps . 
well , that was not at all what i expected . hoo hoo ! whoo . my heart ' s still racing . i just looked a man in the eyes and i shook his hand . all the time i was thinking , " i ' m sleeping with your wife . " and you know who does that ? james freakin ' bond . 
okay , orange slices . there ya go . 
don ' t thank me . thank dylan ' s mom . here you go ! oh ! ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo ! 
you love it . there ya go . 
uh , no , they didn ' t say team . they just said coal hawks . 
well , then it wouldn ' t be the first time i stole something away from coach shane . 
i did . 
no . we just talked . he ' s very nice . 
it did not . 
isn ' t it ? 
i ' m awful , aren ' t i ? 
i ' m an awful guy ! ooh ! 
i am what i am , oscar . and i want what i want . and right now , i want a piece of cake . from now on , when i ' m hungry , i am going to eat whatever i am hungry for . 
i don ' t care . i have an appetite for life ! [ eats cake ] mmm . mmm ! oh , god . that ' s lemon . 
you ' ll learn , baby . you ' ll learn . 
yeah , i noticed that . 
nope . 
i have got big balls . 
okay . [ phyllis avoids looking at michael ] phyllis . okay . look at me . [ continues to look away ] phyllis , look at - - [ phyllis turns to leave ] okay , that ' s . . . [ chases after her ] all right , all right . you know what ? i ' m sick of this . i ' m sick of the little disapproving head shakes . if you think that ' s going to have any effect on me , it will not . i am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet donna . 
because a motel is dirty and it is sexy . like me . and like donna . and frankly , the stuff that we ' re into isn ' t very condo - appropriate . 
okay , morgan freeman - narrating - everything . 
nobody better try to stop me . good . [ leaves the office . door closes ] 
 [ driving in car ; returns to office ; grabs ice cream out of freezer ] how do i feel about breaking up with donna ? good . moral . i feel proud . [ beeping ; cut to donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel ] like a grownup . [ donna receives text from phone ] that was not easy because i really liked her a lot . and i ' m a little bit emotional right now because i know that i absolutely made the right decision . [ donna has disappointed look ; cut back to michael in his office opening ice cream ] at the end of the day , we have to do what ' s right . and it was either living with myself or . . . being happy . and i picked . . . the . . . former . 
yes ? 
 [ sighs ] umm . . . i have done some very bad things , things of which i am not proud . i would like to publicly apologize to . . . the coach and the players . and i vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again . 
oh . okay . i was talking about . . . what do - - what ? what ' s going on ? 
 [ on youtube video ] there is nothing wrong , nor will there ever be wrong with any sabre printers . case closed . [ phone rings , michael picks it up ] michael scott , as seen on tv . 
oh ! pack man , i thought you were a girl ! 
apparently , there are allegations that sabre printers can cause a fire . so they asked me to give a statement to the press . i ' m like , what ? all right . so i do it . it ' s on tv last night . and it ' s in the paper today . and it ' s online . and then i call froggy 98 . 7 , the request line . i talk to the host about it on the air . it ' s like , come on , people , enough . 
everybody , we are at defcon 5 . i am officially the second - most watched clip of the day on the wbre news site . 
oh , that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile . now , we cannot let the pedophile win again ! i would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times . 
yes . 
yes . come on ! get it up ! that ' s what . . . let ' s do it ! 
please . 
really ? a baby otter ? okay , um , count me in as who cares . it ' s not even that interesting a baby otter , it can ' t even stand up . [ looks toward computer ] it ' s trying to stand up . . . [ choking up ] there it goes . 
jo ! we were not expecting you ! 
jo , jo , i can assure you it was no one in this office . 
absolutely . anyone who talked to the press , please raise your hand . 
there is no reason for anyone here to sign this , because i know everything there is to know about these people . i know when their birthdays are , i know what their favorite kind of cake is , i know what color streamers they like . . . 
yes , yes , but it shows a bigger picture . 
okay . 
we should give him a one - way ticket to montego bay , where they keep all the al - qaeda . 
yes . you put them in jail for a long time , you put them in jail for as long as you can . 
i want these people to really pay , i want them to suffer . i ' d prefer it if they died , ' cause it ' s not right . 
okay . 
ridiculous , angela . and like i ' m going to believe one of his spermed lovers . 
is there something that you would like to say to me ? 
about talking to the press ? 
mmhmm . 
i don ' t believe you . 
that ' s a little much . all right , all right , all right . 
okay , i believe you , i believe you . 
did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire ? 
oh , no , no , no . . . 
oh my god . was she cute ? 
oh , god , darryl ! 
i basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it , and then i find out that one of my best ones did . and now he ' s probably going to get fired for it . and if that is not poetic justice , i don ' t know what is . 
you leaked it ? 
i don ' t know what the best plan is , pam . oh god . . . my mind is going a mile an hour . 
oh . 
two whistleblowers . . . two ! i always thought darryl and pam might get me fired for something i said . 
so see you in meredith ' s van in five minutes . 
no , you know what ' s messed up ? this situation all up in here is what ' s messed up ! we need to brainstorm , we need to get out of this ! brain hurricane . come on , think . 
what do we got ? 
it ' s okay , she ' s cool , she also whistle - blew . 
hey , hey , it ' s as interesting as a morgue . 
okay , here ' s what we do . i say we just smash all the computers . we destroy the evidence . no evidence , no case . 
no . okay , not all the computers , just our computers . 
just don ' t say no . 
that ' s just what we need , another black man in prison . you know , let ' s just . . . 
okay . you can count on me . 
hey jo . 
i was thinking about our little leak problem . i was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual . you know what i think we should do ? we make ' em come to work , and we work ' em , and we make ' em sit next to all the people they screwed over . and , and we pay ' em but we make ' em feel like they did something really wrong . the one question i have is , do we give them a christmas bonus ? i say yes , it ' s christmas , but right after they ' re back in the thick of it . 
what ? 
it doesn ' t matter what i know . 
why ? 
well , deal with this . [ crosses arms ] 
what ? 
are you going to kill me ? 
 [ on jo ' s jet ] are we going some place far away ? i know you said no questions , but . . . i have an early dinner that i need to get to . . . with the chief of police . 
i have rights . 
i am not going to tell you anything . 
well , i ' m going through a little bit of a rough patch . 
whole year , actually . my favorite restaurant closed down . 
and my new favorite restaurant sucks . . . i bought a video camera last year , and i was looking at the tapes , and there were only like twelve minutes that i felt was worth taping the whole year . and most of that was just birds in my condo complex . what is that ? . . . i miss holly . 
holly flax from the nashua branch . best hr rep that dunder mifflin has ever seen . it ' s not been a blockbuster year for me financially . my blockbuster stock is down . 
hmm , hmm . 
you know , i would be willing , under the right circumstances , to do that for you . 
i , i surely do , and don ' t call me honey . [ jo laughs ] you were playing too . 
 [ to press ] we at sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers . we regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment . at this time , we are issuing a full recall of all sabre gh400 printers . we will not rest until this problem is solved . there will be no questions . are there any questions ? 
that was fun . 
thanks . today helped . 
okay . hey , you could transfer holly back from nashua . 
 [ performs magic - tricks while lip - syncing ] 
i suppose summer had to end sometime . it ' s sad , though , because i had a great summer . i got west nile virus , lost a ton of weight . then i went back to the lake . i stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot , which hurt . that got infected even though i peed on it . saw ' inception . ' or at least i dreamt i did . 
he ' s not the worst , okay ? he ' s not the worst . you know who ' s the worst ? that intern we had a few years ago . that guy - remember ? eeeh ! that face , how ugly he was ? he was the worst . good worker , though . [ starts drinking coffee ] ah ! it ' s not cappuccino . 
it ' s just coffee , guys ! but , yeah , i ' ll look into it , okay ? 
okay , rude . luke , i want you to go to the supermarket for me . 
to get some ice cream for everybody . it ' s national ice cream afternoon . great . 
and another thing i did this summer , i hired my nephew . 
having luke here is a pretty big deal for me , because his mother , who also happens to be my half - sister , kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a - 14 . the last time i saw luke was the opening day of ' ace ventura ii ' and that was ' 95 , so yes , 15 years on the dot . anyway , i lost him in a forest . 
don ' t bother luke . 
that means don ' t . haven ' t you seen ghostbusters , pam ? 
no , it . . . yes , okay , right . [ erases don ' t ] all right , yep . my bad . i got it . here we go . [ writes " don ' t " in front of symbol ] 
come on . okay , um . . . [ draws a circle around " don ' t " with a line through it ] that ' s as clear as i can make it . 
because i don ' t want it getting back to sabre that we ' re yelling at assistants . i think it would reflect poorly on us . 
nope , it won ' t be gabe but actually , there is somebody in the office that is very , very close to luke . 
well , dwight , he wiped his butt . is that close enough for you ? 
no . no , toby . he ' s not . yes he is . he ' s my nephew . 
luke is my nephew . 
yes , exactly . that is a very nice way of putting it , oscar . mixing family and business is a beautiful thing . 
do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson ? what if no one named hanson showed up ? that wouldn ' t even make sense . or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50 - year - old guy who was a murderer ? really safe . 
god , when he needed help on earth , who did he hire ? jesus christ , his son . 
thank you . 
no ! no . i ' m just saying , why does god get to do something that i don ' t ? 
well , then , why aren ' t you bugging me to fire everybody who ' s bad ? you just want me to fire luke . that ' s reverse nepotism . he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does ! 
because i wanted you to come to me and say , " wow , he is so great . " and i was gonna say , " well , it ' s in the genes . " and i was actually gonna be wearing jeans . and i ' d point to them , right ? no . but you ruined it . so , thank you very much . here he comes . guys , look . i don ' t want you to treat him like anyone else in the office . i just want you to treat him like my nephew . hey , there he is . 
whoo ! whoo ! whoo ! 
ok , you know what ? just - just back off ! back off ! 
all right , those might be his . he might own an ebay store . 
ok , ok . you know what ? this is disgusting . this is like a witch hunt . this is like the blair witch hunt project . 
i ' m reconsidering sending them back anyway . 
wait a minute . 
don ' t - all right . well , ok , you ' ve just committed a felony . 
no , i know they fit . it ' s not about the fit . 
because gabe tattled . i was perfectly happy to just hide it from you . 
you don ' t have all the facts . 
i love him . 
no . no . he ' s my nephew . 
well , this office is my pool . and my house is my house . and i just want my nephew to work in my pool . 
i will cover his ass like moss on a mississippi tree stump . 
luke and i have been working side - by - side as master and commander . me as master , he as commander . occasionally he will need a little push , and i will do that , and he ' ll slow down , and i ' ll push him again . that ' s the thing with kids , you have to keep pushing . you have to push them until they push you back . and then you push some more . it ' s all about give and take , but mostly it ' s about pushing each other . 
luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup . you click on that first , then a whole new - not , no , no , no ! [ luke points laser at oscar ' s forehead ] luke , come on . come on . not on oscar ' s head . alright . luke , come on . stop it ! 
give me the pointer . 
no , just power it down . no , no , no , no , no . not on angela ' s boob . come on . come on . luke , seriously . 
okay . 
all right . okay . good job . okay , email accounts . so we ' re starting with account setup - 
okay , can i have that ? 
ok , i am going to count down from five . 
i ' m not kidding . 
give - okay . alright , give it up . 
 [ bending luke over desk , spanking him repeatedly ] you are going to learn to be more professional , luke ! 
that ' s what you ' re going to do , luke ! 
i had to do that . 
all right . are we good ? [ luke runs out crying ] you ' re okay . he ' s okay . there are many different schools of thought on capital punishment . 
yes , of course . what is this in reference to ? 
would have been nice to work with my family . it would have been nice if luke had been able to stay here . but he couldn ' t . these things seldom work out . i don ' t know how ringling brothers do it . night after night , town after town , all across america . you would think they ' d be sick of each other by now . but , clearly , they make it work . and my hat ' s off to them . 
that ' s it ? really ? that ' s nothing . all right . that ' s highway robbery . 
i can do that . 
okay . wait , what ? 
is there another option ? 
this is the worst ! you are the worst ! i hate looking at your face ! i wanna smash it ! 
ok , you know what ? i made a mistake . i committed corporate punishment . my bad . it ' s over . it ' s done . but my punishment is . . . um . . . worse than hell . 
i know what you want to ask me . " did your mom ever see you naked ? " 
so you can molest me ? oh , ok . i don ' t think so . we ' re going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are . that ' s the key . 
one hour . 
one hour . we ' ve done one hour . let ' s just speed this up , ok ? keep it moving . i want to do all six hours today . 
no , no , no ! i know my rights ! all i had to do was sit here for six hours . do my time . 
you know , do you have any idea how angry this is making me ? 
yes , i will . i will talk alright . be careful what you wish for toby . 
toby , can i really tell you anything ? 
well , the other night , i was sitting at the table , eating my penis . . . i mean peas . that was weird . aaaah . . . weird . i think that was . . . i was probed . by an alien life form . an a . l . f . alf , you know , i might have actually been probed by alf . you might think he ' s a puppet . you never see the lower half . but there is a lower half . 
and i was raised by wolves . i was 25 years old before i saw my first human being . wait , is it a full moon tonight ? [ howls and growls like a werewolf ] 
yes , yes . they are all fake stories . what sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that ? [ pause ] three hours . we ' re half way done . 
this is plenty complicated . 
i ' ve played it once or twice with jeff . 
jeff was my mother ' s boyfriend , who she married . 
yeah , yeah . i guess i never thought about it that way , though . 
yeah . you know what ? he took me to a baseball game once , i remember . it was weird though . they took the pitcher out of the game . i felt really bad , because the pitcher wasn ' t able to play with his friends anymore . but jeff said that the manager was making a really good move , by taking the pitcher out . he really respected the manager . 
i was afraid i would find him in the park , playing with another kid . 
i guess that ' s why i thought he ran away in the first place . to find a kid he liked better . 
right . why would a dog do that ? that ' s silly . 
when i hear myself say it , it sounds ridiculous . but i ' ve never said it out loud , so . . . 
well , lets not get too . . . this isn ' t a counseling session . . . ok . son of a gun . son of a bitch . wow ! ok . 
you . bitch . god ! you ' re very helpful aren ' t you ? you try to help everybody . do you want to play another game ? 
you are good . but you know what ? you can ' t help people . you couldn ' t help your marriage . you lose . i don ' t need your help . nobody needs your help . nobody wants it ! you can ' t help anybody . i don ' t need your help ! am i going to make you cry ? 
ok . 
you ' ll do . . . ok . filled out . good . thank you doctor . take two of these [ giving toby two middle fingers ] and call me in the morning . 
you forged them ! you forged the forms ! 
yes . 
yes , but you had me so worked up that i made a mistake . 
you don ' t make a mistake on purpose , toby ! then it is no longer a mistake . . . gabe . he messed it up . he messed up the forms , i bet . . . [ mimicking gabe ] " i mess everything up so i can fix it and keep my job ! bah ! good thing i ' m here cause i do nothing . i make everybody nervous ! " [ normal voice ] ah , ok . got your notebook ? alright . alright , lets bang this out . let ' s do it to it ! 
 [ cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song ] that was amazing ! that was awesome ! i auditioned for this . when did the cast list go up ? 
really ? they didn ' t call me . who am i playing ? . . . andy ? 
andy , what time ' s the show ? 
how long is it ? 
nope , can ' t make it . 
they say that no one can take your pride , but the people who cast andy ' s play , they took mine . 
i can ' t andy , it ' s too hard . that ' s - i put everything i had into that audition . do you understand that ? 
wow . 
i wish i could , andy , but i can ' t . i have plans that night . i ' m going to see a friend in a play called sweeney todd . you ' re that friend . i ' m going to see your play .

i did not say that to make you feel good . i just said it . total integrity . 
come on , andy , seriously . 
in the criminal justice system , the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups , the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders . these are their stories . kun - kun ! [ imitates vacuum cleaner ] i ' m just a cleaning lady . aah ! a dead body . he wrapped his belt around his own neck . it looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation . yeah , looks like everyone ' s tightening their belts in this economy . [ humming theme music ] last time you saw the victim , was he happy ? last time i saw this john , he was - he wasn ' t a victim , if you know what i ' m talkin about . 
no , that was - i ' m just getting into the first act . 
 [ walks into the office with a large , fake mustache on ] good morning erin , any mustaches ? i mean messages ?

why at least ? if you ' re guessing forty six just say forty six . [ later in his office , places a band - aid over his cold sore ] 
how did this happen , how did i get this ? 
you know what , i feel like one of those old timey sailors . with the eye patch . [ in pirate voice ] it ' s me own damn fault . woman in every port .

 [ makes grunt in attempt to stop dwight . dwight hangs up ] 
hi donna . it ' s michael . 
i have a disease , for which there is no known cure , that has been sexually transmitted to me . 
i can ' t even say it . h - i . . . 
 . . . r - p - e - e - s 
no , i am calling to see if you gave me herpes . because if you did i would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations . so you have it right ? 
does your stupid husband have it ? 
yes i am telling you you have to get tested for herpes . good - bye ! 
no this is holly . 
no this is holly . 
busted . so what can i do for you holly . 
oh really ? was anyone killed ? 
any nuns ? 
 [ dwight looks confused to the camera ] were they in the missionary position ? [ holly laughs ] 
 [ still on phone with holly ] do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn ' t been transferred ? 
we would have twins . [ dwight points towards the corner of his lip , indicating michael ' s " herpes " ] 
mmhmm ! 
mhhmm ! we would be married . 
do what ? 
i don ' t romanticize th - [ dwight nodding and mouthing ' yes you do ' ] no . . . 
he had no arms or legs , he couldn ' t hear see , or speak . . . this is how he let a nation . 
we were more than we were . 
ok , alright i gotta go . 
it didn ' t come up organically . 
it ' s nice to see you doing so well . 
bringing home the bacon . 
 [ after long wait , to dwight ] would you excuse us . . . 
he hasn ' t changed . 
am i the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was ? 
what ? 
well , there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department , but between the sheets we were like jordan and pippin ! 
because we work together . 
am i the princess ? 
 [ sighs ] ok , so i ' m the guy at the station . 
i have herpes . 
i used to think that she was the one . or at least a the one . and if i called that one so wrong . . . 
you know , i don ' t know if i trust jan ' s judgment . she . . . 
no , i ' m not talking about paper . relationships , they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there . 
yes , i don ' t . . . 
i know , i know . 
got it . 
i ' m trying ! god ! 
 [ walks into park with dwight ] hi stranger ! long time ! 
i ' m michael . we dated for a while . 
oh hey ! dwight , would you take my grandmother for a walk while i talk to helene ?

just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing , breaking all the rules . but had to end , because the summer was over . for you . . . 
jerk . [ walks off ] 
real entertainers , like billy joel . 
carroll , how are you ? 
i ' m great ! i saw your - your sign outside . and i decided , i ' m going to pull in , and maybe buy a house from her .

someone told me that i romanticize relationships 
i have herpes . 
i just found out today . it ' s , uh , right there . 
mmhmm , i ' m sorry . 
i ' m between specialists right now . 
well i believe in love at first sight . 
i knew what i was thinking at the time , but right now it just seems ridiculous . 
hi holly it ' s michael , i just wanted to call and let you know that i was thinking about what you said . it ' s just . you know ? it ' s weird . today i ended up seeing a lot of women that i used to date , and in my mind they were all great . and then when i actually saw them , it was mostly a freak show . and you and me , that must have been a real train wreck . you know what , holly ? you ' re wrong . you are wrong . i remember every second of us . and talking to them today , i don ' t feel for them anything like what i feel for you . i didn ' t joke with any of them , i joked with you . you are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me . and i don ' t know why you downgraded what we had but i did not make us up . ok . oh , wait , and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes . bye . 
oscar , we once sucked face in public . as part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing . do you recall ? 
you may have given me a sexually transmitted disease . 
herpes duplex . 
i have already contacted all of my ex - lovers except for you .

i will see you in ten . bye ! hold tight . [ hangs up ] well , i know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me , and to be honest , so did i . . . and the only reason i got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in .

no ! okay . [ runs out the door ] all right . 
oh , no , that ' s a male model .

you know who we always lose out to ? staples , the big guys . osprey ? they ' re a small company . they ' re smaller than we are . what ' s our excuse ? how do we combat this guy ? stanley , how do we combat him ? 
okay . you know what ? you clearly don ' t care , so why don ' t you just leave ? 
why don ' t you go outside and . . . take a shot of insulin and have a nap , okay ?

i owe you . . . a most sincere and humble apology . we were trying to watch you to see your sales technique , so we could stop losing so many clients to you . 
a surveillance room next to this one . 
yes . and it ' s the sincerest form of flattery . 
well - 
okay . you know what , it wasn ' t just me . jim and dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well . 
no , we don ' t . here ' s - here ' s my point . danny , listen , you have to understand that we are not normally like this . we just - we wanted to know your tricks .

answer the question . do you want a better life , danny ? 
i know , i know . 
do you want more freedom , less freedom , or to stay the same ? 
i can give you more money - there ' s your better life . i can let you come and go as you please - there ' s your freedom . and you already know dunder - mifflin has the best service and the best prices , but you beat us anyway . can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff ? 
everyone , may i have your attention ? i would like to introduce you to mr . danny cordray . he is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman . say hello to danny ! 
o - kay . you know what ? no . no . this is not some sort of construction site . . . or all of italy , where you can just go around treating people like meat . we are to respect him . i respect him because he reminds me of somebody . can anybody guess who that is ? 
no . no . no . somebody in this office .

no , no . wrong . he would have stolen your clients , but you know what ? he can ' t now . this guy used to steal sales from us ; now , he ' s going to steal sales for us . 
he doesn ' t need to sit , he ' s a traveling salesman . look , i am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you . and unless you have a better argument than that , i suggest you leave . 
good - bye ! 
this morning , danny cordray stole a sale from me . so what do i do ? i go out and i steal danny cordray . the sale that mattered , i made . boom . funny thing about it , we don ' t even need him . we already have packer on the road . chhguuh ! crap . i forgot about packer .

so , wait , drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road ? 
blackula ! 
oh , so . . . i almost forgot . you ' ll find this hilarious . apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now . that ' s like , exactly sort of the idea that you had . 
yeah . i ' m sorry . i blew this . you should have gotten credit for that , man . 
really ? we ' re good ? 
okay . [ reaches out and shakes darryl ' s hand ] okay . 
oh . it ' s a ream of paper . thought you might hit me . 
darryl philbin is the greatest guy in the world . and you know what i ' d like ? i would like to have all the racists brought together and take darryl philbin out to lunch . just to see what they ' re missing . 
erin ! would you please do me a solid and get darryl philbin on the speakerphone ? 
hi , darryl , come out here , please . 
you need to stop being so shy , come out here , and embrace who you really are , superstar ! 
yeah , i bet it is ! if you ' re gonna do your job well here , you gotta get used to being embarrassed . 
this whole delivery slash sales idea ? you know whose idea that was ? that was darryl philbin ' s . he thought of that way before the corporate fat suits . 
i got in the way . i said no . and it just stopped . but then corporate comes up with this idea , but you know what ? they need to know that it was yours . and i don ' t care if i take a bullet . we ' re gonna call them , we ' re gonna put them on speakerphone right now . . . 
and we are going to straighten this out . 
mmhm ! 
i ' m a little peeved at darryl right now . 
no , he didn ' t go behind my back . he went over my head . 
what is taking someone from behind ? 
it was a good idea , though . 
 [ staring at gabe and kevin ] what the hell are they talking about ? 
do you think that kevin is going over my head ? i don ' t - [ sees kevin and gabe fist - bump ] oh my god . okay . all right . all right . you know what ? that ' s inappropriate , kevin . i am your boss , and if you have something to say , it goes through me , and then i take it to gabe . chain of command . do you understand ? 
oh , you ' re sorry ? 
what did you just thought ? 
all right . 
okay . 
well , don ' t let it happen again . 
i - 
okay , this whole going over my head - gate ? is making people act weird . the chain of command is crumbling . do you know what just happened ? i just made kevin cry . and gabe looks like lady gaga . that ' s not halloween . halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other . 
you went over my head . and then you lied to my face . so my head and my face have taken a beating . 
okay , that might help . if you said " i ' m sorry " in front of everybody . 
in front of me . 
so that ' s it . 
is it ? 
yeah , i gotta get in on this . [ mocking darryl ] hey , it ' s cool , man , i work in the warehouse ! i ' m cool ! i ' m hip and i ' m jive ! and i don ' t care about nobody ! do you know who i am ? happy halloween , jerk ! 
still don ' t know who i am ? i ' ll give you a hint . i go over other people ' s heads . 
what ' s a bad idea ? 
never ! [ tosses wig ] okay , you know what ? fine . i ' m not darryl . and thank god i ' m not darryl . 
hey , can i play ? why don ' t you ask if darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back ? 
aaah ! darryl moved it . you moved it . 
dwight , you saw darryl move it , right ? 
if you had one word you would use to describe darryl what would that word be ? 
thank you . 
if they ' re good ideas , i ' m not gonna say no ! 
that was - okay , you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals , after everything i did for you ? 
oh . . . 
well . . . 
stop it ! stop , stop . we ' re thinking . we ' re thinking about it . 
you don ' t have to point to the fact that we ' re thinking about it . stop it ! just let us think . okay , next time you have a really great idea , we will put it in a hat , and then we will have erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide . 
i am not budging on the hat issue . 
okay . we both reserve the right to go to jo if we disagree with gabe . 
unless you and i decide we want to talk to jo , then we ' ll give her a call . 
sorry i was a jerk . 
friends fight . friends fight . 
that ' s true , that ' s true . i dated her momma , and you know what - 
 [ under his breath ] um . . . kay . uh , alright .

good morning . 
jim and pam and cece really seem to be clicking . they are totally gelling . it ' s as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness . and good for them . that ' s great , because , you know , the paper industry ' s not gonna last forever .

 [ pam in the background struggling with cece ] better men than gabe have tried to be my boss . david got fired . charles got fired . jan went crazy . ed truck , who i liked , got decapitated . 
yeah , well i wasn ' t very hard to find . 
is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust ? 
so these are pizza dogs , they aren ' t pigs in a blanket per se . 
well . . . 
he ' s the longest baby in this room . 
you know what erin you do have to . 
 [ grimacing ] that ' s what she said . [ leaves ]

oh do not raise your voice to me ! 
gahh , i will pull this car over ! 
 [ enters , looks to gabe ] if you break that girl ' s heart , i will kill you . it ' s just a figure of speech . but seriously , if you break that girl ' s heart i will literally kill you and your entire family . 
gabe , just go and have fun with erin . but not too much fun ! that girl ' s gonna turn my hair gray . 
 [ as the power and lights come back on ] my bad . space heater and fan were both on high , plugged into the same outlet . 
uh . . . try " password " . 
uh . . . it was like eight years ago ? 
okay , moving backwards , our i . t . guys have been . . . glasses , turban , ear hair , fatty 3 , shorts , fatty 2 , lozenge , and fatso . i think lozenge was the one who installed it . 
you know what ? it made me laugh when i heard it , but pam got really offended . 
the important thing is . . . this kept us secure people . 
morning . 
 [ wearing ryan ' s glasses ] i ' m facebook . 
i sent you a facebook message yesterday , i still haven ' t heard anything back . 
a what ? 
dot com ! 
i think an investor ' s ski trip is the best idea . it will be a bonding experience . 
i was looking at a trail map , and i was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill , because i ' ve never actually been skiing . and then work our way up to death drop . 
your kidding ? ! 
you and me . 
don ' t you work here full - time ? 
mm - hmm . 
that does sound fun to me . 
excuse me , everyone . . . sex ! now that i have your attention . . . 
money ! 
pervert . 
that ' s good to know . [ screams ] 
wuphf ! all right , i ' ve warmed them up for you . you have the floor , ryan . 
whoo ! 
we already have a buyer . 
at least . 
that ' s right ! 
wait , ryan , so this could be over by the weekend ? 
no , not this weekend ; next weekend . we were gonna go on the investors ski trip . i bought poles . 
look at that . triple your investment by january . 
there you go . 
do not talk like that , stanley . 
here we go . 
 " it ' s ryan the wuphf guy ! " 
 " he ' s up there . " 
look at that ! he threw ' em on the ground ! 
no , it ' s not weird , andy , and you know what else ? we have an offer from washington university . so monetize that . 
what ? 
i won ' t sell . and you know what ? ryan and i have the majority of shares . isn ' t that right ? 
i - - yes . we ' re not selling . i will not sell . 
can ' t talk , saving the planet . 
we don ' t ? well , why have i been separating the trash into whites and colors ? 
 [ throws the sack of garbage onto the floor ] eight years . 
no , i won ' t even consider it . 
right , yes , yeah . best friend / mentor . 
i think you are wrong . 
you may be right . i may be crazy . 
i ' m just saying that i think i agree with your point . 
i thought it might make me feel better . 
 [ singing ] but it just may be a lunatic . . . [ stops singing ] no . 
good , good , bro . 
always have your back . so , any ideas on how we can get over this nine - day hump here ? 
nine days , though . that ' s , like . . . 
yes , you have tapped this . hard . 
maybe i could take a second mortgage on my condo . 
so you would think that ' s a good idea for me to do ? 
mm - hmm . 
yeah , well , we never even have dinner now , so . . . 
tonight ? 
oh right . what am i saying ? rain check . 
hello . 
i . do not agree to sell , which is to say nay . 
i ' m not blind ! i know exactly who he is . he is selfish and lazy and image - obsessed , and he is a bad friend . [ all seem to be in agreenment ] and he ' s also clever . and he shoots incredibly high . and he may just make it . but you know what ? even if he doesn ' t , i would rather go broke betting on my people , than get rich all by myself , on some island like a castaway . and there is no middle ground . 
only if he fails . and you know what ? ryan , i believe in you . just like i believe in all of you . you have nine days to save everybody ' s money . 
you can ' t have it . 
the world sends people your way . . . ryan came to me through a temp agency . andy was transferred here . no idea where creed came from . the point is you just have to play with the cards that you ' re dealt . [ camera pans to different people in the office ] jim , that guy is an ace . dwight is my king up my sleeve . phyllis is my old maid . oscar is my queen . that ' s easy . gimme a hard one . that ' s what oscar said . toby is the instruction card you throw away . pam ' s a solid seven . and yeah , you know what ? ryan is probably , like , a two . but sometimes twos can be wild . so watch out . and i am obviously the joker . so . . . [ phone rings , computer chimes , etc . ] that ' s uh . . . 
thank god . 
 [ examines items on the reception desk ] mmhmm , china . china . 
it was great . china . 
everything here was made in china , pam . 
they used to make stuff in america , andy . but we ' re falling behind , did you know that ? china is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir . 
yeah , right here . it is right there . [ holds up magazine ] anybody read the news any more ? 
i found that in the waiting room at the dentist ' s office . this kid had the magazine i wanted to read , that ' s the only one i could reach and i read it and then i read it again . 
my whole life i believed that america was number one , that was the saying . not america is number two . england is number two . china should be like eight . 
what ? 
so much for keeping our secrets up high . 
i know what we ' re going to do . we ' re going to put our best minds on it . 
everybody stop working . i want you all to imagine a world in which america is not the number one superpower , where forks are irrelevant , and where every man , woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello . now open your eyes . 
welcome to your future . 
how do we stop it ? with a big idea . that ' s what america is built on , big ideas . blue jeans , the grand canyon . whose got one , whose got a big idea ? 
yes , indeed . yes kevin . 
once a week antacid is the idea to beat . anyone else ? nobody ? okay then we are . . . yes . 
i don ' t know . 
alright . 
i don ' t know what the [ expletive ] that was . 
no he ' s not right . we ' re not . where would we even drop it , phyllis ? did you know that in china there are fifty six cities with over a million people ? you know how many we have here ? nine . 
no , no . that is right now . 
in terms of land , not population . 
no , no you ' re wrong about this . 
i got it from newyorktimes . com 
so i happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office . so what ? [ laughs ] i don ' t care . 
okay , now where were we before i bested oscar ? 
absolutely , pam this is exactly why i hired you as office administrator , handle it . taking care of business . 
very comedically humorous jim . 
try ' control p ' . 
not if the printer isn ' t hooked up . you are making some very dangerous assumptions oscar . 
hey . 
mmm . 
yeah . 
sure . 
coffee jim . 
yes . 
alright , well i just need to learn everything about china . to be safe i should learn everything about everything but i don ' t have time . okay , okay , i ' ll just learn about china and science and geography and math and literary . 
i ' m pretty good on politics . " california is bankrupt , and california , california . " [ jim and andy follow michael into his office ] what ? 
pass . 
pass . 
lifeline . 
i could talk about boobs . i bet he knows nothing about boobs . 
wait , wait , wait . how long is this going to take ? 
is it going to be worth it ? 
i don ' t need to cheat . 
did you know , that china has a new missile , that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast ? 
did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal . but what do i know , i mean , that ' s just according to the pentagon . our pentagon . 
china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars . we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives . and they will control us . 
how then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in china has risen by 17 % and in the us it has only risen by 8 % ? 
don ' t . . . i . . . 
yeah , i figured that . 
wait . you forgetting something ? 
this chat . two men , one white , one latina . a boss and a money cruncher . i could fire you . 
here we are . 
my point is . . . that as long as people like you and me don ' t stop talking , nobody can stop the usa . 
i am talking about freedom , about choice . america , i don ' t think you need to worry . because if you want to beat china you will . if you don ' t , that ' s fine . that my friend , is your victory . y ' know , a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to china , and that may be the true , but what they don ' t tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation , you get to a friend . so here is to conversation . 
raise your cups on high . case closed . 
people , wait , wait , wait . come back , come back . one fun one . we ' re gonna do a fun one . 
that ' s it ! that ' s a picture ! yes ! jump in the air . we ' re gonna jump in the air . here we go . 
okay , everybody jump in the air this time , please . here we go . 
don ' t answer that . people , listen up and listen good . we need to just get one picture where we ' re all in the air at the same time . yes ? 
i believe in us . we can do this . here we go . 
we didn ' t get it . 
oh , ho , ho , ho ! oh , ho , ho , ho , ho , ho ! merry christmas , little children ! [ dressed as santa ] 
how ' s everybody doing today ? 
how ' s the party coming along ? 
are we over budget ? 
no ? good . did anyone get drunk already ? 
good for you . angela , lay it on me . what ' s the problem ? 
so stanley , how big is the bug up your butt today ? 
alright . well , i will be in my office making toys for the good children . andy ? 
whatcha got ? 
well , that ' s a relief . santa ' s gonna take some much - needed free time . alright . good ! 
my kids are growin up . as a boss , i look at that and say great . it is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that ' s what i want . that ' s what every boss wants is a , is a wonderful christmas with no drama . 
yeah ! 
pam ? pam ? 
hi . 
uh , because you ' ve been on the lam ? because the ' boring police ' have been after you , and they finally caught up with you ? 
yes , the case of the horrible red - headed sad sack . and the verdict , it was toby . and the sentence , death . death to toby ! 
you know what you , you , you leave these huge pauses in your sentences . what do you expect me to do ? 
that was the worst joke ever . 
okay . okay goodbye , goodbye . 
what ? what ? 
hold on , holly ' s coming back here ? 
that is a great question , erin . how do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend , and was a lover , and was a complicated part of my past , and maybe , just maybe a part of my future ? 
holly ' s coming back , everybody , and we have to have a party . 
you know what , we ' ll postpone this party until then . this is too important . cancel this one . dwight get rid of the tree . 
cancel . we ' re canceling it . [ michael starts to throw away all of the food ] 
no , we have to cancel the party . 
no , no , no , we ' re gonna get fresh for holly . fresh and new . 
i know . 
it ' s not . they ' re not . fresh and new . please let go . please let go . 
well then everybody ' ll chip in , it ' ll be fine . 
you know what , i ' ll pay for it . i ' ll pay for the party . it doesn ' t matter . this is way too important . people , holly ' s coming back , and this is the most important christmas party of my life . so back to work . 
man , i worked hard . i worked so hard for this ! i was after corporate constantly . i emailed joe . i wrote letters . and , know who i end up owing this to is the scranton strangler . thank you . thank you , scranton strangler . i love you ! you just took one more person ' s breath away . 
we have always had good christmas parties here , as you know , but they ' ve never been cool . [ imitating sean connery ] the name is bond . . . santa bond . i ' ll have an eggnog , shaken , not stirred . classic brosnan . santa . . . wonderful tradition . everybody loves santa . everybody can ' t get enough of the jolly old man . but that is a myth , because you know what , he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard . he ' s not necessarily an old guy . no one knows what the real santa claus . . . god ! ow ! [ camera pans down to angela pinning michael ' s pants ] 
well , this year ' s gonna be different . we ' re gonna have fun . it ' s not gonna be tacky . it ' s going to be , you know what , the food is going to be austere . it is not going to be tacky , deli platter food . it ' s not gonna have a big , fat , gross santa claus . it ' s gonna be cool , sleek santa . 
okay . sure . 
you never know about the press . 
could he help us with some parking tickets ? 
well , then he ' s not a senator . 
okay . 
okay . . . [ sighs ] oh , no , no , no , no ! fake tree . no , no ! 
pam , no , no . holly ' s coming from new hampshire . somebody from new hampshire looks at that and thinks it ' s a burning cross . no , no . i want you to go and get a real tree . take some money . thank you . 
yes , that ' s me . come on it . 
 [ scats awkwardly ] there ' s nothing classier than boring jazz music . i am here to tell ya . and i made a bit of a judgment call . i hired one musician , because i thought , what ' s better , to hire an entire quartet for half an hour , or one bassist for the entire day ? 
when holly gets here , i want you to be very helpful to her . 
she doesn ' t need an internet presence , you just know . 
what the hell are you doing here ? you ' re supposed to be in the courthouse . 
and then he will come back here and replace holly , so stop asking him questions . 
there she is . hey . erin , would you help her , for god ' s sake ? 
hello . 
 [ imitating her accent ] well , i never thought i ' d see your face around these parts , you old bastard . 
 [ as curly ] why , you ' re some sorta wise guy , huh ? 
nyuk , nyuk , nyuk , nyuk ! 
 [ as homer ] d ' oh ! 
hi . hi . oh . . . [ they hug ] 
oh no , not the huggy monster ! i don ' t wanna die ! i don ' t wanna die ! i don ' t wanna die ! [ both sigh ] wow . well , everybody , you remember holly . 
that ' s adorable . 
well , you came on the day of our christmas party . 
isn ' t it wonderful ? we love it here . don ' t you love it ? all right , let me show you to your desk . [ in a stereotyped mexican accent ] i show you to your desk . 
what kind of guns do you have ? six - shooter ? 
this is weird . i can ' t believe you ' re here . this feels like you never left . doesn ' t it ? 
oh . . . 
oh , and you have a woody . bah ! [ the both chuckle ] oh , i love toy . . . 
well , that ' s understandable . still raw . woody your favorite character ? 
you know who my favorite character in toy story is ? andy ' s mom . 
because without andy ' s mom , there ' s no plot . and without any plot , there is no movie . 
you ' re kidding me . ahh ! 
what a douche bag ! 
get a . . . yeah ! good riddance . 
mmhmm . 
good for him . 
really ? that ' s creepy . how did aj get in your house ? 
oh , you do ? 
 [ fighting back tears ] yeah , randy newman ' s the best . 
me too . 
hey . 
hey there , jada . nice to see you again . i ' m santa claus . welcome . 
it ' s a sophisticated take . 
yeah , well , i was told that holly would be here , single and ready to date . and we all got misled . 
nora ephron , in every romantic comedy ever made . 
i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer , and some people you don ' t . and that ' s just the way it is . and i can be mature about that . [ clip of michael throwing holly ' s woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it ] 
what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window ? you know what would have happened ? the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off . and , yes , it might have been funny . but it also would have been incredibly tragic . 
all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story . you see this on my desk ? [ he holds up a toy taxi cab ] know who gave me this ? my girlfriend tara , who lives in new york city . 
i haven ' t told you about her . 
i ' m a man in my mid - 40s and i still get zits . i think that ' s pretty interesting . but you know what ? i am not on trial here . the scranton strangler is . so , anyway , we have this great weekend , and she drives me to the airport , and we get to jfk , but i am flying out of laguardia . so we laugh and laugh and laugh , and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slo - mo , drinking latte . and at the end of the day , she gives me this , and she says , " michael , maybe next time , you should take a cab . " 
i do . she is . 
did you see her face ? well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g . scott . and it ain ' t tara . 
what happened ? what happened ? toby , what did you do ? i think toby ' s very jealous of all the attention you ' ve been getting . 
oh , really ? turn it on me . well , isn ' t that nice ? thank you very much . 
it is christmas . 
mmhmm . mmhmm . well , the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me . and that i have been framed . 
ahhhhhh ! [ laughs ] surprise ! it was part of the party . pretty funny , huh ? 
 [ laughs ] i don ' t . but someday i think we will laugh about this . . . when we tell our kids . . . 
all right . shh . okay , you know what ? holly , i didn ' t mean to do it . it was an accident . an accident borne of jealous feelings . 
oh , really ? you certainly seemed jealous when i told you about my fake girlfriend . that ' s what jim and dwight thought . 
when you got transferred , and i drove you up to nashua , you said , " michael , i love you , but i can ' t do this . " but then , with this other guy , you don ' t have any problem with a long - distance relationship , do you ? and you know what , that is what is the matter with me . 
and we did this whole stupid party for you . 
mmm . erin , would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me , please ? 
hey 
nice to see you again , aj . welcome . 
good trip down ? 
good , good . good to see you . have fun . enjoy the partay . 
i am dead inside . 
oh , hey , hey , no , don ' t run . you ' re gonna slip . 
yup . i read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice , and she hit her head and went into a coma forever . and then every day , her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died . 
 [ voice breaking ] yeah , well , at least he was married . 
no , it ' s not . it ' s not . oh , man , i can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay . 
really ? 
no . 
yeah . i mean , i can wait till then . come here . i don ' t want you to fall . 
i was in the mall , and i saw that , and i thought it had your name written all over it . 
no , that ' s not . . . no , i went to the mall and i picked that out especially for you . 
 [ hands kelly a receipt from his wallet ] from the mall . that . . . 
well , that . . . 
hey . 
oh . 
thank you . a hostess apple pie ! this is my favorite breakfast . how did you know that ? thank you very much . 
oh , you know , i seem to remember that santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for christmas . didn ' t he say that ? 
i think i know where he is . 
mmhmm . 
video games . 
a dsi ? 
a horse . 
you , are you sure you don ' t want a pony ? you want a real horse ? 
all right . you have to pick up after them . 
january three , 2011 . a day which will live in - famously . holly partridge flax , otherwise known as holly , otherwise otherwise known as a living , breathing angel , is engaged to another man . this is freaking me out . i - okay , let ' s switch to the happy video , okay ? no , no , no , no , let ' s push through . we ' ll do this . 
today will either be the best or the worst day of my life . holly gave aj an ultimatum . he either proposes by new year ' s or they break up . now , if she ' s engaged , i ' m gonna go crazy , and i ' m gonna start attacking people . if she ' s not engaged , in all honesty , i may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness . either way , i am going to need some talking down . and nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down . 
 [ filming video ] michael , i know what you ' re thinking . holly ' s engaged to another man , and you want to kill yourself . it may seem like a good idea , but it ' s not . 
okay , so killing yourself . [ laughs ] i was just thinking about snot . 
happy . 
sad . to soak up my tears . 
bears sad , worms happy . come on , erin . 
sad , something to break . 
for you , job well done . 
both sad . 
i did ! i did , indeed . two front row center , to paula poundstone , live in poughkeepsie . holly ' s favorite . i hope she doesn ' t call us up on stage . that would suck . " hey , you think you can do my job better ? " i don ' t know . " what ' s your name ? " michael . 
shaaa - shut up . hello . 
so . . . high five me . we ' re back . to a happy . . . [ grabs holly ' s hand ] look at those ! mittens . are those a present ?

yes , no , why ? stop ! yes . 
oh my god ! that ' s it ! that ' s it !

 [ in video ] whoa , whoa , whoa , okay , calm down , breathe .

 [ in video ] nice ! we ' re gonna calm down later . 
i ' m good .

 [ imitating e . t . ] e . t . phone holly . holly like phone ? 
 [ imitating e . t . ] why ? 
 [ imitating e . t . ] bummer . 
 [ imitating e . t . ] reese ' s pieces . 
i still have my old phone . this thing . . . indestructible . [ slams phone on desk , phone breaks ] 
holly doesn ' t seem to be engaged , but she ' s talking to aj like she is . i can ' t figure it out . do you think she ' s already dating a different aj ? 
when you broke it off with roy , did you still tell him you loved him ? 
but you did still love him . 
do you love him now ? 
no . she ' d just resent me . or worse ! she would think of me as her friend . [ disgusted voice ] oh , hi friend ! blegh . 
you think she ' d talk to you ? 
that ' s true . she ' s really nice . she ' d talk to anybody . why don ' t you bring erin to balance you out ? 
or sooner . 
that ' s not a joke . 
is it ? 
next year ? come - i mean , what is the point ? what is the point of that ? i made a resolution to floss , and i did it . 12 : 01 , january first , bam ! blood everywhere . 
what is wrong with you people ? can ' t you stick to anything ? erin , i want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables . creed , you say you want to do a cartwheel ? nothing ' s stopping you . come on , old man , do a cartwheel ! 
you ' re just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what ' s going to be on your tombstone ? loser . 
just do a cartwheel ! 
 [ holding broccoli in front of kevin ] eat it . 
no . no cheese whiz , no hollandaise , no chocolate sauce , just eat it . come on . here comes the airplane , there you go . open , open , into the hanger , there you go . 
eat it . put it in your mouth , and just eat it . 
i don ' t care whether you hate it ! you said you ' d do it !

all right , all right , shh ! 
let me see if you swallowed it , open your mouth . under your tongue . [ reveals hidden broccoli , spits it out ] oh , god ! you guys are pathetic . 
no ! you can ' t have any candy ! 
 [ imitating e . t . ] holly flax . 
 [ imitating e . t . ] not michael , e . t . 
well , i just want to talk about what happened in there . 
holly , come on in . thanks for coming . i thought there should be an hr rep here for this . so , kevin and creed , things got a little bit intense in the conference room . 
and i wanted to apologize . these resolutions should be about you , and i made it about me , and it was none of my beeswax . 
it was insensitive and i am sorry . 
i really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions . the cartwheel , the veggies . . . i . . . care about you . very much . and you loom so large in my heart that i crossed the line . 
you ' re right . and i hope that we can still be friends . 
okay , oh ! all right . 
okay . 
no . 
yup . 
you can toss them . 
my resolution ? i never want to make holly cry again . unless it ' s from laughing too hard . or making love too beautifully . 
look at where you ' re going to be doing the cartwheel . so look at where you ' re going to be placing your hands . so pick a spot . 
you ready to do this ? 
you know what ? i ' m going to stay here as long as it takes . 
it ' s about you . it ' s about you . go ! 
you did ? 
okay . 
congratulations . all right . well , all right . see you tomorrow .

you know what might be kind of fun ? i was thinking , you know andy is having a seminar today ? what if we went in as a greek couple ? mikanos and . . . 
okay . 
holly broke up with a . j last week , which is the greatest thing that has ever happened . . . to me . to holly , it ' s been the worst week of her life , and i know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever . too much information ? that ' s what i thought . but , you know what ? here i am using it .

 [ rubbing hands with holly ] are these numbers correct ? 
okay .

whispering and tickling have their place in business . 
i . . . okay , yeah , that ' s pretty hot . i will give you that . look , you are all hypocrites . you all do it . 
thank you . 
all right . 
okay . fine . no more pda .

ah , the old " leave behind . " oldest trick in the book . good thing it ' s working . 
since when is comfort the most important thing ? i mean , i don ' t . . . i don ' t sit on your lap because it ' s comfortable . i sit on your lap because i like the way your thighs feel on my butt . 
oh . okay . well , if it makes you uncomfortable , then we ' ll stop . 
holly and i are like romeo and juliet . and this office is like the dragon that kept them apart . 
hey , you know why people here are complaining ? they are jealous of two people in love on valentine ' s day . 
i love you . 
i love you - love you . 
i am really disappointed in the office ' s policy on pda at this moment . i love you . [ shakes holly ' s hand ] 
yeah , whatever . no big deal . just the hottest girl in the world loves me . 
hello , holly . 
here , shake . no ! 
no , we can ' t . 
no touching . ah , i ' m trying not to touch you . 
oh . 
oh , no , so close . oh . no , we can ' t do that . we can ' t do this . ohh . 
i don ' t know what your body feels like ' cause i can ' t touch it . 
grab you here . 
i will grab you here anyway . [ laughs ] 
never . 
i did say i would , but i was wrong . i can ' t stop . you don ' t what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back . it is a feeling that cannot and will not , and frankly , cannot be contained . 
yes , it was that . it ' s that one . 
we ' re not supposed to pda . 
i haven ' t thought about you having to go back to nashua . 
that ' s what we said last time . remember ? we broke up on the drive . how ' s this gonna be any different ? 
i was in love with you . 
 [ chuckles , sighs ] 
it ' s like a time bomb . . . 
 . . . is ticking down . when it goes off , no more kissing . no more hugging . 
sexual time bomb . 
 [ into recorder ] boner bomb starring jason statham . or we go against type with an eisenberg or a michael cera . 
no . [ into recorder ] saving the world has never been this hard . 
no , i can ' t talk to her . i can ' t even look at her without thinking about it ending . 
do the monkey face . 
i love that . i love that face . 
no . the monkey ! 
don ' t do the squirrel . throw your poop . 
that ' s good . 
that ' s good . he ' s throwing it . 
i know . 
holly . hey . 
holly , i love you so , so , so much . and i think we need to break up . 
actually , it ' s valentine ' s day . shouldn ' t be doing this today . i ' ll talk to you tomorrow .

well , the point is , there will no longer be any need for pda here at the office between us because , when we get home , we are going to make love to and with one another , and that , to me , is the best valentine ' s day present that a person could receive . so i bid you all adieu . 
i do . 
what are our plans for tonight ? umm . . . 
leave it at reception . 
 [ pulls out two handguns and kills the man with an unnecessarily large amount of bullets ] clean up on aisle five . [ threat level : midnight titlescreen appears ] 
after three years of writing , one year of shooting , four years of re - shooting and two years of editing , i have finally completed my movie , threat level : midnight . 
erin . . . what are you doing ? 
that ' s . . . that ' s . well , don ' t put words in my mouth . 
sweet , i will go invite holly . 
mhmm ! it ' s got action , it ' s got heart , it ' s got some bosom . 
it ' s got a lot of me . 
ladies and gentleman , threat level : midnight . [ applause ] 
dwight does not play a robot . 
 [ lying on bed with a bottle of alcohol ] i ' m up . 
tell him i ' m retired . 
goldenface , this makes it personal . 
 [ holding a quarter up ] heads i do it , tails i don ' t . best out of seven . [ flips the coin ] heads . [ flips it again ] tails . [ president winces each time he says tails ] . . . heads . . . tails . . . heads . . . tails . [ flips one more time and the quarter spins around on the table . michael looks at it ] well , it looks like there ' s going to be a clean - up on aisle five . 
i ' m not here to learn how to mop , i ' m here to learn how to play hockey . 
what am i supposed to do with this ? 
 [ michael and goldenface skate around the rink , goldenface shooting with a solid gold gun , michael with two pistols . michael is out of breath at the end of the race ] nice try goldenface , but you forgot one thing , to kill me . 
no ! 
yeah ? 
 [ begins to cry as goldenface laughs ] 
congratulations . 
i am sorry that i have to do this . . . [ starts choking oscar to death with his towel ] 
i ' m so sorry . i ' m so sorry . 
not who , what . the funky cat is the hippest jazz club in town . [ stands up with his cup of tea and walks by samuel , pouring his tea all over him ] 
 [ walking into the funky cat ] bingo . 
 [ pulls out a recording device from his pocket and clicks it on ] 
jack blaise . 
by far and away , the most expensive shot in the movie . but , it was integral to the story . 
the joke ' s on you goldenface , that man was a wanted animal rapist . 
he said , where is the bomb ? 
why are you telling me this ? 
hey goldenface . 
go puck yourself ! 
that was not scripted . 
more tylenol . 
it ' ll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain , lungs , heart , back , and balls to kill michael scarn . 
for the insurance money ! i knew it all along ! [ the president , goldenface , and his minion pull out automatic machine guns ] you will never get away with this ! [ takes a painting of abraham lincoln and awkwardly smashes it on the president ' s head , runs out of the office as goldenface and his minion shoot at them ] 
where had i gone wrong ? all i wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife . but somewhere along the way , things got messed up . 
 [ in a bar ] beer me billy . 
i got problems billy . big problems . . . 
 [ laughs to himself ] don ' t ever change billy . goldenface is going to blow up the nhl all star game tomorrow . 
i ' m too depressed to save the big game billy . 
no billy , i haven ' t done that dance since my wife died . 
 [ a funky beat sounds from the jukebox and michael starts dancing poorly ] well my name ' s michael scarn and i ' m here to say , i ' m about to do the scarn in a major way . [ the bachelorettes and the others in the bar stand up to join him ] you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand . you meet new friends , and tie that yarn , and that ' s how you do the scarn ! [ doing the actions he says to ] you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand . you meet new friends , and tie that yarn , and that ' s how you do the scarn ! you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand . you meet new friends , and tie that yarn , and that ' s how you do the scarn ! 
 [ turns off the movie from the remote , the office complains ] 
 [ to holly ] well that ' s a . . . pretty good reaction . [ holly nods ] pretty cool , right ? did you like it ? did you like that ? 
okay . [ stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office ] no , it ' s not good enough . it ' s not good enough . . . 
hey . 
mmmm , good ? everybody out there says it ' s great ! 
did you ? what did you love about it ? 
no , no . holly , this isn ' t ocean ' s eleven , where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don ' t care about how it turns out . what ' d you really think , honestly . 
is it , is it because you ' re afraid of where this is gonna take me ? see , because i need you . . . to keep me grounded . 
 [ angrily ] it was eleven years , okay ? this has been my dream for eleven years , and if you don ' t think it ' s great than you ' re basically saying that you don ' t believe in my dream . 
i talk about a lot of things , holly ! i was eventually gonna get around to my dream ! obviously ! eleven years i could ' ve been working on the scarn nebulus . 
because , if i don ' t have this , what do i have ? i have nothing . 
i have my book on business , somehow i manage . i have my hbo comedy special , here i go again dot - dot - dot . but you know what ? when i think about it , when i really think about it , none of those things are as real to me as my movie . 
yeah , you ' re a real pain in the ass . and i ' m gonna go watch the movie with people who think it ' s great ! and i ' m sorry i called you a pain in the ass , i ' m angry , and i love you . 
i am a huge woody allen fan . although i ' ve only seen antz , but i ' ll tell you something . what i respect about that man , is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press , about how antz was just a rip - off of a bug ' s life , he stayed true to his films . or at least the film that i saw which again was antz . the thing is . . . i thought bug ' s life was better , much better . than ants . the point is , don ' t listen to your critics , listen to your fans . 
who likes threat level : midnight ? [ applause from the office ] okay then who wants to watch the rest ? ! [ everyone yells approval ] 
i know , it ' s a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on ! 
 [ crying ] this one ' s for you cherokee jack . [ michael skates into the rink of an already in - play match ] 
we filmed this during an actual scranton high school hockey game , trying to qualify for states . 
no , no ! actually it ' s really screwed up because they [ chuckles ] , they were trying to qualify , they were disqualified , they had to forfeit the game . undefeated season . that ' s why there were so many people there . [ michael stands up , clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought ] 
hey . . . 
no it ' s not . [ kisses holly while smiling ] it ' s not . but , they really seem to be enjoying it . 
 [ ees cherokee jack from a confusion of heavenly light and smoke ] cherokee jack . 
 [ laughs at the stupidity ] 
 [ skates forward , hits the puck , and stares in wonder as it flies by ] 
 [ in scarn manor ] some breakfast for me [ shows a plate of bacon and eggs ] and some breakfast for you . [ pulls out an oil can and oils samuel ' s circuit board on his back ] 
oh yeah , i guess i did let him be a robot . 
 [ phone rings ] i ' ll get it ! man i love being retired ! scarn here ! 
hello sir . 
ugh . . . [ after a little thought ] i ' m in . 
oh yeah ! [ laughs ] yes he is ! 
no , no dwight . he ' s just being stupid . [ the office laughs ] 
still not seeing the problem here . 
it was the best of times , it was the awesomest of times . and now packer wants to come home . and ohh , look who ' s here to sign off on it ! my boo , holly . 
hi . [ holly and michael kiss ] 
oh , michael ! this ' ll be just us . 
oh , yes yes yes yes . just so you know , he ' s at his funniest when you ' ve given him five shots . 
and it also helps if you ' ve had five shots . 
whoa ! 
is packer here ? 
 [ peering into conference room ] don ' t know , don ' t care . 
 [ sees holly and todd shaking hands in the conference room ] yes ! the pack is back ! ladies and gentlemen , i would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction , probably because most of you have done it with him . just kidding he wouldn ' t be interested in any of you . in all seriousness , todd packer , is a permanent salesman at this branch . and i would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms . 
you did ! you got burned , because packer ' s back ! packer is turning in his car for a desk . he is turning in his condoms , for a condominium ! although he ' s probably going to have to use condoms from here on out . 
special delivery for dwight k . schrute . 
and i don ' t have anything for you . but i do wanna talk to you about something . we have been thinking about where packer should sit . . . and we can ' t just sit around and wait for creed to die . 
so you wouldn ' t mind permanently relocating , so that packer can take this desk here . [ jim looks appalled ] 
 [ grunting as he crawls under dwight ' s desk . dwight follows ] let ' s look at this . 
don ' t be a baby ! okay ! there it is . packer was here and so was your mom ! [ todd starts humping dwight and michael who are still under the desk . 
no ! 
best day ever . best day ever ! 
question , should i get stripes shaved on the side of my head ? 
please . 
yeah , you love him right ? [ holly seems unsure ] you love him . i can tell . 
no . not me , him . 
whoa ! look , are you jealous of him ? because you think he ' s funnier than you ? oh honey . . . 
he ' s funnier than me . 
so i ' m less funny than not funny at all ? 
 [ seems taken aback ] uhm . . . 
that ' s insane ! 
and you made hank smile , that doesn ' t happen often . you ' re very charming . that is something you should take upstairs , and use on people that really matter . [ hank looks irritated again ] 
i don ' t know , holly mentioned that there were some complaints . and that you had said some things about kevin . 
yeah . 
i guess you said something weird about your daughter ? 
you ' ve been on the road a long time . and you ' ve been an outdoor cat . and now you have to be an indoor cat , so you can ' t be peeing all over the walls . 
no it isn ' t . 
yeah , a little bit . 
i won ' t . 
 [ michael and todd are walking into the office ] okay , every body . i need you to see this . because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated , who will surprise you . todd packer , is going to apologize . kevin ! front and center , come here . 
kevin , we know that you are just trying to save face , we know that you are hurt and embarrassed . 
okay , sweetie , no . you shouldn ' t be apologizing to packer . that doesn ' t make any sense . you ready for this ? you ready for this ? gentlemen , start your engines . 
kevin , do you accept the apology ? 
okay , go back to the annex . 
that - that was maybe too much . packer is a survivor of divorce stanley . packer doesn ' t speak with his child , meredith . packer never lived up to his parent ' s expectations , andy . [ andy looks confused and shrugs ] angela loves pussy cats , and packer loves - 
i was going to say dogs ! okay , you know what , this is over ! apology has been issued ! and we ' re through with it . packer will be here until the day he dies , just like the rest of us ! 
what are you doing ? 
i cannot believe this , you ' re sending packer to florida ? why ? 
okay , so you ' re tricking him into flying to florida ? 
you have to tell him . you have to tell him what you did . 
he is my oldest friend , i am going to tell him . 
yes , about that . 
well . . . i don ' t know if that ' s a good idea . 
no , nothing like that at all . 
sorry ? 
 [ thinks a moment ] sounds great . 
that is . [ jim sees them and looks happy ] it ' s gonna be awesome . i think you ' re really going to enjoy it down there . 
nah , he ' s an ass . 
 [ imitating ] you ahh . 
no you ahh . 
 [ kisses her and speaks normally again ] you ahh . 
i uh . . . i actually don ' t know why i brought that because it ' s kind of priceless . 
mhmm , no i paid 500 dollars for that . 
500 . 
get lost . 
that is how you do it . 
you know it ' s really more for a bachelor pad . i just want to get a fair price . 
in case . . . in case of what ? 
i don ' t have an in case . do you have an in case ? 
get lost . 
 [ on phone ] yes , hello mr . flax this is michael scott , your daughter ' s boss . i am calling because i am going to have to fire your daughter holly because she is such a terrible employee . i ' m just kidding . i ' m kidding . i ' m actually calling because i ' m in love with her . i love your daughter , and i have for some time . and i would like to discuss my intentions with you . . . which are to ask her to marry me . and i was just hoping you would give me your approval . and this isn ' t a joke . so call me back , when you get this . and i look forward to speaking . thank you . 
hi . 
oh , you know what , you have a siphon ? i think i ' m gonna run out of gas . 
well , i ' m writing a message . 
i ' m asking holly a question in fire . 
maybe . 
hey you know what ? i ' ve got gas all over my hands and my shoes . would you light it ? would you do the honors please ? 
pam .

yes . 
i could not have agreed with you more . 
yes . thank you . 
no , no , no , no . my minds made up i am not going to change my mind you can ' t talk me out of it . 
i had a great idea until you ruined it . 
how about this i throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof , it hits the ground , the head pops off , this leads me to the line ' i lost my head when i fell in love with you . ' 
it ' s easy enough to get a corpse , you just go to a med school . i already have the ring . 
heres the ring . 
yeah . i saved 3 years salary . 
is she not going to like that ? 
at a gas station ? 
that mush have been a surprise when . . . at the gas station you proposed . 
oh yea you didn ' t say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect . i want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever . 
i just . . . it ' s terrifying . 
i know but i ' m still scared i don ' t know why . 
get this . . . kevin thought i was gonna sell my bowflex for 200 dollars and i told him ' dude this was a prop in my movie . ' 
ok it ' s because we haven ' t sold anything . you know what ? we just wait until the end of the day , people get desperate , and they ' re gonna pay anything . 
oh ok . for how long ? 
is he alright ? 
you ok ? 
yeah , yeah well you definitely need to do that . 
ok . 
no , no , shhhhut it . mhmm . oh god . nope , nope , nope . 
no . i am not going to be proposed to in the break room . that is not going to be our story . mhm hm . should have burned this place down when i had the chance . 
hey , how ' d we do ? 
that ' s great and we still have most of our stuff . good . 
no , no , no , no , lets not talk about that . 
shhhh . let ' s go on a little walk . you know what ? i wanna show you some stuff . 
so this is one of my favorite places in the world . 
this is where toby announced that he was going to costa rica . happiest day of my life . until the day you came to replace him . let ' s go in here . 
this is where we first kissed . 
and this is where we first made love . remember what i tried there ? 
through these blinds is where i first saw you , and you had all these boxes , and i thought you were the prettiest mover i had ever seen . and i was sitting at this desk when i called you to tell you that i had herpes and that i was still in love with you and you said that it was over , and that you didn ' t love me . thank goodness none of that was true . including the herpes . 
in - grown hair . 
right in here . . . this is where we first co - ran our meeting . remember , obesity awareness ? 
we saved a lot of lives that day . that ' s where you first met michael klump . 
and right over there is where you found out that meredith was prostituting herself for outback steak . and i will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn ' t believe it , you thought it was so wrong . 
and over here . . 
well , nothing . nothing really . i would just find an excuse to come here so i could stare at you through that window . this is what i ' d do . [ runs water through hand ] 
let ' s go in here . 
this is where our love faces its toughest test . after this , its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives . 
that guy ' s got more than he can handle as it is . 
that marriage would be a sham . 
easy no . 
that would be hot . i would pay to see that . 
only one that i was kind of worried about . 
 [ the area where holly ' s desk is is filled with lit candles ] this is where i fell in love with you . and this is where i ask you to marry me . it started with . . [ fire sprinklers go on ] holly flax , marrying me will you be ? 
thank you . so guys , guys , guys . we ' re moving to colorado . 
yep . 
holly has to go back to colorado . i ' m going with her . i ' m leaving . 
kahlua sombrero , please .

 [ pops up from below camera , and runs out of room ]

come on out ! 
i am well , sir , how are you ? 
and we talk for like 20 minutes , no clue it ' s deangelo the whole time ! 
i happen to like the hilarious hijinx i get myself into . there he is ! deangelo , i was just telling them about last night , when we met . remember that ? that was crazy ! 
oh yeah . . . i know . . . that ' s what i was just saying . . . that ' s what . . . 
this is jim and pam , aka jap . what started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes . 
yes it was . 
are you kidding ? i ' d come anywhere to see a turtle ? where ' d you find him . 
you know me very well , dwight . 
now i ' m gonna have to go online and look at turtles or i ' ll be off all day . 
so you decided to have an orgy and not invite me ? i call the middle ! 
i sorta like the old way . 
i know , i know , i ' m sorry , but if it ' s not a big deal we should just - 
is that good ? 
well , whatever . whatever you think will work . 
you can do the old way or whatever you think would work . [ phone rings ] 
 [ to erin ] shave me . [ walks into office with deangelo ] this is going to be funny ! looks like we are going to be shaving buddies ! 
and this is erin and she is going to shave my face . here we go . [ erin puts too much shaving cream on michael ' s face , none on the neck ] 
it really does . this is luxery . here we go . ah , that is nice . 
well , we don ' t really do rap sessions . we kinda do . . . [ erin shaves michael ] god . . . we sorta do more of like powwows or - 
that ' s - 
you know what , everybody ? you have to be honest , here . you can ' t say that everything is perfect . so , you know , come up with something . 
ok , you know what , i mark it urgent a , urgent b , urgent c , urgent d . urgent a is the most important , urgent d you don ' t even really have to worry about . 
don ' t shave my lips . 
you know , this office sort of has a perfect feng shui to it , so . . . you know , let ' s not go overboard with the re - decorating , and i ' m still here - 
i still have to look at this stuff , guys . 
deangelo ' s great . i love the guy . but i ' m not sure he ' s a great fit for the office . and also , i ' m not sure if i love the guy . 
 [ interrupting deangelo ] snack time ! it ' s the witching hour ! it ' s the sandwitching hour ! 
pb and j , my mom ' s recipe ! [ throws sandwitch at phyllis ] 
i think kevin wants one . kevin , here you go ! [ throws sandwitch into kevin ' s open mouth ]

oscar , here you go . [ throws sandwitch ] 
no one had a problem with the air here until you came around . 
no , that ' s good . you just stay in there , stay in there by yourself , loser . no body go in . [ disgusted comments by co - workers ] no body go in there . stay where you are . 
no , it ' s not insane , oscar . i ' m been here for 19 years , and just because someone else is called the boss , you ' re gonna throw it all away ? no . 
well , who needs him . guess it ' s just you and me , dwight . 
i start with some chit - chat and a maybe a couple of jokes . and you might want to develop a couple of characters . you know what , you ' ll be fine . 
ok . [ hugs deangelo from behind ] why did you have to be so damn good ? 
no , no , no . come on . you are good , they know it . 
guess i ' ve been working so hard i forgot what it ' s like to be hardly working . 
you ' ll figure it out . 
it is six a . m . [ deangelo yawns ] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their dundie nomination certificates . just like the oscars ! 
every year ! this happens , you have a lot to learn my friend . [ deangelo laughs ] 
why do you always say that ? you ' re gonna love it . 
 [ arriving at the first house ] alright let ' s go ! [ deangelo runs in the wrong direction ] this way , this way ! [ michael knocks on the door ]

yeah that ' s fine . 
 [ next house ] hey toby ! you suck ! [ throwing eggs at his house ] 
 [ giggles ] go go go go go go ! 
 [ arriving at a dumpy looking , unkempt house ] i ' ve never seen this place in the daylight . 
here we go , alright got it ? set ? [ the door is ajar , michael knocks lightly ] hello ? [ turns around to see meredith walking towards her house ] 
yes you did . that ' s right ! congratulations meredith . we should head out . 
 [ quietly shuts the door ] go . 
 [ walking into the office ] good morning erin . 
you have big plans for tonight ? 
you are getting so funny ! [ erin giggles ] very good . 
the dundies are my baby , and they need to go on . when larry king died they didn ' t just cancel his show . they got pierce morgan to come in , and do his show , and , that way , larry lives on . 
anything can happen at the dundies ! [ deangelo laughs ] they ' re like the golden globes but less mean . and i just want all of us to have a good time ! 
black tie optional . 
a la , tonight we will be hosting at louie volpies ! 
shh , shh ! okay , okay . everybody ' s right . they ' re like breadsticks on steroids . right ? 
so as you know , the dundies are my legacy . so i ' m going to need to train a replacement . so this year , i have decided to have a co - host . [ dwight looks suspecting ] and that person is [ he and deangelo roll their tongues as a drum roll ] deangelo ! [ all applaud ] 
think of it as part of your training . 
 [ smiling ] okay , well we ' ll work on it . 
you are doing it . 
 [ all in conference room ] guys ! i want you to help us work on some banter . 
here we go ! so , deangelo ! you and i have a lot in common . you lost two hundred pounds , and i lose my car keys every morning . 
 [ cutting him off ] okay , okay . you know what , i didn ' t actually lose my keys . . . 
mmmmkay . there needs to be what you call a rat - a - tat . and right now it ' s all rat and no tat . ryan come on up here . tap deangelo out . just watch this . okay . [ ryan stands next to michael up front ] ryan how are you today ? 
 [ very excited ] there you go ! lovely ! regis and kelly ! nice ! use that as an inspiration . just be funny . 
no ! god ! [ jim looks at him oddly ] 
no , no , no ! this is the performance of your life ! 
jim , please no loopholes . 
this is my last dundies ever , if i want mind control over him , is that too much to ask ? 
good . good . good ! 
now , tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood . 
 [ getting off his stomach ] too personal . i don ' t wanna hear about it . [ picking up a portable tape player ] let ' s try this . put these on . [ deangelo puts the headphones in ] i am going to turn this on , and turn the volume all the way up . so you can ' t - [ deangelo winces ] that ' s right , you ' re not going to be able to hear yourself . read this , [ gives him a card ] and make it sound perfect . 
say it with an accent ! 
 [ also in a poor australian accent ] the dundies ! 
i ' m here . [ deangelo gasps and turns around ] in a good way ! i ' ve been here the whole time . 
 [ in the bathroom ] deangelo , what are you doing ? there ' s a live audience out there ! 
no , ryan would never do it . it ' s too on the radar . look , look . the boss , hosts , the dundies ! it ' s sort of our perk ! 
listen to me , you ' re not doing this for me , you ' re not doing this for you , you ' re not even doing this for them ! 
 [ slaps him ] you ' re doing this for all those kids out there , eating off the louie volpies kid ' s menu , wondering : does it get better ? what i want you to do , is i want you to say : it ' s showtime . get out there . 
say it . 
you can do it , just say it . 
now hit me . [ deangelo slaps him ] one , two , three . 
alright , here we go . 
okay ! okay ! sorry about the delay everybody ! but we were at the dmv waiting in line . [ everyone laughs ] 
there are a lot of great salesmen in this office , but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad . and a close personal friend of mine , jim halpert ! best dad dundie ! [ dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard ] 
well done . 
alright . [ all applaud jim ] 
which moves us to , best mom dundie . [ pam gets ready and jim smiles at her ] i guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office . meredith palmer ! 
year after year , i catch a lot of flak on this particular award , because year after year i present this award to a guy instead of a girl . hottest in the office goes to , [ ryan stands up ] danny cordray ! [ ryan quickly sits ] danny couldn ' t be here tonight . . . 
stanley hudson is a grump , everybody knows that . [ stanley looks angry ] but did you know , that stanley hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes . the diabetes award goes to stanley hudson ! [ stanley slowly walks over , angry ] come on up here you sick bastard . 
you know , herpes affects one in five sexually active adults ? [ manager looks up , angrily at michael ] pippy longstocking , ronald mcdonald ' s wife , ron howard , ron weasley , what do thay all have in common ? red heads . erin hannon , come on up here and receive your cutest red head in the office award ! [ erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage ] 
 [ escorts erin off stage ] there you go . 
it is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you . but he is a good guy , so the michael scott award for best dundies host goes to deangelo vickers . [ deangelo jogs up and takes the dundie and tries to go back to his seat ] 
 [ stopping manager ] deangelo is expressing himself . [ manager pulls the microphone cable , everyone can still here deangelo . 
okay , we ' re done ! that ' s it . 
we ' re done . we ' re done ! 
 [ outside of the restaurant , obviously sad ] so that is how it ends . my last dundies ever . i was hoping it ' d be more like godfather three . that rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way . but instead it is like godfather one ! that was , very confusing , had maybe three big laughs . oh well . . . 
what ? 
no , no . you ' re being too hard on yourself . we had a very truncated rehearsal time . 
so what you ' re saying is you kinda like it ? [ phyllis impression ] i ' ve fallen and i can ' t get up ! [ normal again ] that phyllis bit , that was pretty good . 
that got a big laugh . 
 [ to stanley , who is cracking up again ] you were laughing right ? 
we ' re really close . 
that ' s true , we wouldn ' t get seats together . 
 [ in the car ] you know , despite a couple hiccups , i think that went very well . 
man ! maybe you should have won the kind of a bitch award . 
what is your problem ? ! 
okay ! that , that is unfair ! the clothing was safe , but tasteful . 
he is in an all - out sprint . 
 [ in conference room ] here . . . [ andy walks in ] okay ! by his own omission , this person actually tried marijuana in college , so the doobie doobie pothead stoner of the year award goes to , andy bernard ! [ andy walks up ] 
oh , okay . [ nods to him ] 
oh my god , something ' s happening . 
 [ choked up ] yeah , okay . [ pauses , then takes a deep breath ] well this is gonna hurt like a mother [ bleep ] . 
no it ' s not . 
here he comes ! alright ! you deserve it ! [ toby comes up and take the mic ] 
 [ sitting on the roof of the office building ] well , i ' m moving to colorado to start my new life with holly . just up here , getting used to the altitude . 
yes ? 
ahh , thank you . like a butler . 
 [ michael takes one and bites ] oh , these do not taste like oysters . 
sick freak ! what is wrong with you ? 
i don ' t own dunder mifflin , okay ? [ dwight scoffs ] the job was not mine to give . [ sighs ] look , i need your advice on something . i am told that there are bears in the rockies . 
well , i was just thinking that maybe i should keep a salami in my pocket . . . 
 . . . in order to feed the bears . 
how do you mean ? 
okay , so no salami in the pants . how about a pepperoni ? 
okay . 
hm ? 
well i have interviews . 
yes . yes , you know what ? take my favorite truck . sure . 
oh you don ' t , that ' s - 
that sounds good . thank you . 
sad ? no , no , no . i don ' t leave ' til tomorrow , so . . . tomorrow i will be a wreck . 
 [ walking in ] there they are ! party planning committee together again ! 
mmm ! 
you know what , i ' m thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody ' ll like . how about vanilla ? let ' s get vanilla . 
tomorrow i want everyone to have a good time . no drama . and as for today , just a typical day . alright ? 
what do you like pam ? 
what kind of toppings would you like ? 
sounds good . fudge it up ! [ all seem surprised at michael ' s behavior ] 
 [ holding up his " world ' s best boss mug " ] i bought this for myself . and yesterday , they gave me this . [ holds up a dundie that reads , ' world ' s best boss 2011 , michael g . scott ' , throws his mug into the garbage can and places his dundie at the front of his desk ] i still need something to drink out of though . 
 [ pulls out a list of everyone in the office , then puts it back in his jacket ] attention everyone , before i leave tomorrow i would like to reveal a secret i have kept for over twenty years . a secret about phyllis . 
when phyllis was in high school , she was so . . . cute . [ phyllis looks relieved ] and she still is . 
ahh . 
 [ hesitantly ] sounds great , i just think it ' s great . oh , i have gifts as well ! [ goes into his office and comes out with a bag ] and i will start , by giving the first gift to phyllis ! phyllis , you are shy and sweet , and you don ' t often speak your mind , but you should . because you have great ideas . so phyllis , i am giving you this , so you can always remember to speak your mind . [ presents to her a mouth wind - up chattering toy ] 
stanley , you love your sudoku and your puzzles , i bestow upon you , my felt . [ gives stanley a small felt table ] may you never lose the fun loving quality in life . 
well , okay . . . and andy , andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman . i give you , my clients , our ten most important accounts . [ other salesmen look outraged ] 
but you ' re the best salesman , on the inside . 
you sold us all on andy , a product that nobody wanted . 
you ' re not gonna lose them . 
just do your best ! i have faith in you . 
kevin , i have something for you . 
you know who that is ? 
 [ rips the poster in half ] don ' t be a caricature kevin , never be a caricature . how did that feel when i tore that up ? 
good , stand up . [ kevin does so ] you will be thin . you won ' t drool over pizza like an animal anymore . 
you will find love . 
don ' t be . you should never settle for who you are . [ moving on ] oscar , oscar , oscar ! oscar , you are - 
 [ quietly groans ] okay , you know what ? just do your best buddy ! okay , oscar , you are very smart , and you have a gigantic education . and , i think of you as my scarecrow , because you gave me a brain . so that ' s why i made you this . [ takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head , with a face drawn on , obviously the product of poor craftsmanship , oscar pretends to like it ] 
 [ laughing ] it looks like a [ more laughing ] it looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm ! he just accepted , accepted that i put all this work into it ! [ laughs more ] he has the lowest opinion of me , of anybody ! 
was it just me , or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point ? 
how would you have wanted to do it ? okay , okay . you know what ? inappropriate . i am engaged happily , and you have landed yourself a senator . 
mmhmm , bravo !

i guess this could be the one , huh ? 
my last pay check ? 
no .

 [ crying ] i can ' t do this . all the channels are gonna be different there . i ' m not gonna be able to find my shows . i ' m not going to start improv at level one , and i don ' t think my credits will transfer . ugh , and you know what ? i just figured out where i was supposed to go to vote . [ picks world ' s best boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk ] i gotta call her , and i ' m going to tell her , that i cannot come . [ dials on his phone ] 
hi . what is the name of our town ? 
no , no . i just needed to hear your voice . 
 [ laughing ] yes . [ olive oyl impression ] yes my hero ! 
 [ laughing ] ohh , i miss you .

 [ grimaces and nods , toby nods back at him ] okay . 
 [ walks over to kelly ] kelly ! kelly ? kelly .

 [ in ryan ' s office , which is illuminated blue ] she was once my girl , and she is your girl now .

mmmhmmm . it ' s true . darryl , i have one last wish . i would like to use the bailer .

 [ in warehouse ] darryl said i could use the bailer because i ' m leaving . 
 [ picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket ] alright guys , well . . . see ya later warehouse . catch you on the flippity flip . [ throws the ball behind him and misses the basket , tries and misses several more times ]

[ misses again and grabs it back ] flippity flip ! [ makes it in , gets excited ] really ? [ composes himself ] okay , see ya guys ! [ walks away , containing his self - pleasure ] 
kevin ? 
ahhhh . . .

[ erin is smiling ] and when the right guy comes along , you ' ll know it . you will . [ kisses her head ] and you know what ? you don ' t need a mom . because you have my number , and you can call me anytime . 
n - 
okay . [ both chuckling . michael leaves erin , looking thoughtful ] 
phyllis . phyllis , are my mittens done ? 
listen to me . it ' s two p . m . from now until four , your priority is knitting . knit like the wind . 
dwight , i will be leaving tomorrow . [ pulls out an envelope from his jacket ] 
so i wanted to give you that . [ hands him the envelope ] it ' s a letter of recommendation . [ dwight looks eager . michael nods to him and walks away ] 
 [ in the office , crosses dwight off his list . he has paint in his messed up hair , and is containing his laughter ] 
you should see the other guy . 
 [ looks at the clock to see it is three o ' clock ] jim where is pam ? 
but it is already three o ' clock ! [ michael leaves , jim gives a knowing look to the camera ] 
 [ in his office talking to creed , gabe , and meredith in that order ] whether you ' re scared of dying , or dying alone , or dying drunk in a ditch . don ' t be . it ' s going to be okay . 
yeah i was tripling up . there ' s not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody . 
 [ gabe is still standing in front of michael ' s desk ] and you , why are you still here . 
no , you are not going to quit today . for goodness sake , this is not going to be your last day in the office . everybody gets dumped gabe . can i give you a piece of advice ? [ gabe nods ] a little cover - up on your adam ' s apple will make it appear smaller , and make you look less like a transvestite . [ gabe looks awkward and michael winks ] 
 [ standing in front of his office , sees that it is three forty five ] okay , everybody come on . conference room five seconds ! let ' s go ! hurry up , let ' s do this ! [ dwight runs into the conference room . all others follow ] 
what is this meeting about ? 
okay , here we are in the conference room . once again . and i just wanted to call you all here , together , because i have something important . well there ' s two things actually . okay first , i would like a whereabouts on pam . [ jim looks regretful ] and secondly , phyllis how are those mittens coming ? because i would actually like to bring them home and pack them . i ' m leaving for the day at four . 
 [ cutting her off ] well power through the arthritis phyllis you can do it ! 
umm , hmm ? 
 [ the office looks up expectantly ] ummm . . . hm . . . no . [ changing his mind ] no . there ' s a special guest that i would like to invite to say one last goodbye . so here he comes , he ' s coming right in . [ walks out and then back in , now using a vietnamese accent ] oh hi everybody , it ' s ping ! [ the office groans ] and i ' m here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people ! thank you everybody ! you ' ve been so wonderful ! [ only kevin is laughing . stanley tries to leave . michael hugs him ] i ruv you all ! i ruv you very much !

 [ sad ] ohh . . . 
 [ holding back tears ] okay . . .

why am i so sad ? am i doing the wrong thing ? 
 [ pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it ] t - shirt idea , goodbyes stink . okay , alright . so . james halpert . [ starts to cry ] you started with this company , as a fine young man . . . 
oh , okay . 
 [ hears a taxi honking ] oh shoot ! that ' s my cab .

i am looking forward to lunch . and hearing about what a great boss i am . 
okay . . . [ crosses jim off his list ] phyllis . 
no no no , let me see . [ picks up the mostly knitted mittens ] oh phyllis , nice try . i love ' em . [ waves goodbye to her with the mittens ] [ michael begins walking out the office , he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working , and jim looking back , teary eyed ] 
later guys . [ leaves the office ] 
got almost everybody . so . . . holly ' s my family now . [ you see video of michael getting into the cab , and driving off . as the cab leaves , pam drives in ] she ' s my family . the babies that i make with her , will be my children . the people that you work with , are just . . . when you get down to it . . . your very best friends . they say , on your deathbed , you never wish you spent more time at the office . but i will . gotta be a lot better than a deathbed . [ you see michael getting out and entering the airport , and going through security ] i actually don ' t understand deathbeds . i mean , who would buy that ? 
 [ putting his shoes back on , talking to the camera crew ] well , i guess this is it . hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs ? thank you . alright . . . oh ! [ pulls out his mic from his shirt ] this is gonna feel so good , getting this thing off my chest . [ he hands them the body mic , when he speaks it is inaudible now ] that ' s what she said ! [ waves goodbye and walks off to his gate , halfway there pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while . they say their goodbyes to each other , and michael walks off for good ] 
that’s what she said . 
 [ crying ] i feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other . it’s every parent’s dream .
