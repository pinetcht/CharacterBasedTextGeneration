hurry up ! come with me ! what are you waiting for ? ! get in gear ! 
shape it up you guys ! . . . biggs ? 
i didn ' t know you were back ! when did you get in ? 
the academy didn ' t change you much . . . but you ' re back so soon ? hey , what happened , didn ' t you get your commission ? 
i almost forgot . there ' s a battle going on ! right here in our system . come and look ! 
there they are ! 
but there was a lot of firing earlier . . . 
hey , easy with those . . . 
look who ' s talking . now that you ' ve been around those giant starships you ' re beginning to sound like my uncle . you ' ve gotten soft in the city . . . 
well , things haven ' t been the same since you left , biggs . it ' s been so . . . quiet . 
what are you talking about ? 
join the rebellion ? ! are you kidding ! how ? 
you ' re crazy ! you could wander around forever trying to find them . 
and i ' m stuck here . . . 
not likely ! i had to cancel my application . there has been a lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left . . . they ' ve even raided the outskirts of anchorhead . 
i know , but he ' s got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off . he needs me for just one more season . i can ' t leave him now . 
it couldn ' t happen here . you said it yourself . the empire won ' t bother with this rock . 
i wish i was going . . . are you going to be around long ? 
then i guess i won ' t see you . 
well , i ' ll be at the academy next season . . . after that who knows . i won ' t be drafted into the imperial starfleet that ' s for sure . . . take care of yourself , you ' ll always be the best friend i ' ve got . 
it looks like we don ' t have much of a choice but i ' ll remind him . 
but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters . . . 
all right , come on ! and the red one , come on . well , come on , red , let ' s go . 
uncle owen . . . 
this r2 unit has a bad motivator . look ! 
uncle owen . . . 
what about that one ? 
yeah , take it away . 
okay , let ' s go . 
it just isn ' t fair . oh , biggs is right . i ' m never gonna get out of here ! 
well , not unless you can alter time , speed up the harvest , or teleport me off this rock ! 
well , if there ' s a bright center to the universe , you ' re on the planet that it ' s farthest from . 
uh , you can call me luke . 
hello . 
you got a lot of carbon scoring here . it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action . 
you know of the rebellion against the empire ? 
have you been in many battles ? 
well , my little friend , you ' ve got something jammed in here real good . were you on a cruiser or . . . 
what ' s this ? 
who is she ? she ' s beautiful . 
is there more to this recording ? 
obi - wan kenobi ? i wonder if he means old ben kenobi ? 
well , i don ' t know anyone named obi - wan , but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea . he ' s kind of a strange old hermit . 
i wonder who she is . it sounds like she ' s in trouble . i ' d better play back the whole thing . 
h ' m ? oh , yeah , well , i guess you ' re too small to run away on me if i take this off ! okay . 
there you go . 
well , wait a minute . where ' d she go ? bring her back ! play back the entire message . 
all right , i ' ll be right there , aunt beru . 
well , see what you can do with him . i ' ll be right back . 
you know , i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen . 
well , i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him . he says he belongs to someone called obi - wan kenobi . 
i thought he might have meant old ben . do you know what he ' s talking about ? well , i wonder if he ' s related to ben . 
but what if this obi - wan comes looking for him ? 
he knew my father ? 
yes , sir . i think those new droids are going to work out fine . in fact , i , uh , was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season . and if these new droids do work out , i want to transmit my application to the academy this year . 
sure , there ' re more than enough droids . 
but it ' s a whole ' nother year . 
yeah , that ' s what you said last year when biggs and tank left . 
it looks like i ' m going nowhere . i have to finish cleaning those droids . 
what are you doing hiding there ? 
oh , no ! 
how could i be so stupid ? he ' s nowhere in sight . blast it ! 
it ' s too dangerous with all the sandpeople around . we ' ll have to wait until morning . 
all right , i ' ll be there in a few minutes . boy , am i gonna get it . 
you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble . 
old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere , but i don ' t see how that r2 unit could have come this far . we must have missed him . uncle owen isn ' t going to take this very well . 
wait , there ' s something dead ahead on the scanner . it looks like our droid . . . hit the accelerator . 
hey , whoa , just where do you think you ' re going ? 
well , come on . it ' s getting late . i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up . 
no , he ' s not going to try anything . 
what ' s wrong with him now ? 
sandpeople ! or worst ! come on , let ' s have a look . come on . 
there are two banthas down there but i don ' t see any . . . wait a second , they ' re sandpeople all right . i can see one of them now . 
what happened ? 
ben ? ben kenobi ! boy , am i glad to see you ! 
oh , this little droid ! i think he ' s searching for his former master . . . i ' ve never seen such devotion in a droid before . . . there seems to be no stopping him . he claims to be the property of an obi - wan kenobi . is he a relative of yours ? do you know who he ' s talking about ? 
i think my uncle knew him . he said he was dead . 
you know him ! 
then the droid does belong to you . 
threepio ! 
can you stand ? we ' ve got to get out of here before the sandpeople return . 
no , you ' re not . what kind of talk is that ? 
no , my father didn ' t fight in the wars . he was a navigator on a spice freighter . 
you fought in the clone wars ? 
i wish i ' d known him . 
sure , go ahead . 
what is it ? 
how did my father die ? 
the force ? 
i saw part of the message he was . . . 
i can ' t get involved ! i ' ve got work to do ! it ' s not that i like the empire . i hate it ! but there ' s nothing i can do about it right now . it ' s such a long way from here . 
look , i can take you as far as anchorhead . you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever you ' re going . 
it looks like sandpeople did this , all right . look , here are gaffi sticks , bantha tracks . it ' s just . . . i never heard of them hitting anything this big before . 
these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio . 
why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas ? 
if they traced the robots here , they may have learned who they sold them to . and that would lead them home ! 
uncle owen ! aunt beru ! uncle owen ! 
i want to come with you to alderaan . there ' s nothing here for me now . i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father . 
about three or four seasons . 
go on , go on . i can ' t understand how we got by those troopers . i thought we were dead . 
do you really think we ' re going to find a pilot here that ' ll take us to alderaan ? 
i ' m ready for anything . 
what ? 
listen , why don ' t you wait out by the speeder . we don ' t want any trouble . 
i ' m sorry . 
i ' ll be careful than . 
ten thousand ? we could almost buy our own ship for that ! 
you bet i could . i ' m not such a bad pilot myself ! we don ' t have to sit here and listen . . . 
that ' s okay . i ' m never coming back to this planet again . 
he says it ' s the best he can do . since the xp - 38 came out , they ' re just not in demand . 
what a piece of junk . 
why don ' t you outrun them ? i thought you said this thing was fast . 
are you kidding ? at the rate they ' re gaining . . . 
what ' s that flashing ? 
are you all right ? what ' s wrong ? 
you mean it controls your actions ? 
you don ' t believe in the force , do you ? 
you know , i did feel something . i could almost see the remote . 
what ' s going on ? 
what do you mean ? where is it ? 
what ? how ? 
maybe they know what happened . 
it followed us ! 
it sure is leaving in a big hurry . if they identify us , we ' re in big trouble . 
it must have gotten lost , been part of a convoy or something . 
look at him . he ' s headed for that small moon . 
i have a very bad feeling about this . 
why are we still moving towards it ? 
but there ' s gotta be something you can do ! 
boy , it ' s lucky you had these compartments . 
you know , between his howling and your blasting everything in sight , it ' s a wonder the whole station doesn ' t know we ' re here . 
i want to go with you . 
but he can . . . 
ben is a great man . 
i didn ' t hear you give any ideas . . . 
who do you think . . . 
what is it ? 
well , who . . . who has he found ? 
the princess ? she ' s here ? 
oh , no ! we ' ve got to do something . 
the droid belongs to her . she ' s the one in the message . . . we ' ve got to help her . 
but he didn ' t know she was here . look , will you just find a way back into the detention block ? 
they ' re going to execute her . look , a few minutes ago you said you didn ' t want to just wait here to be captured . now all you want to do is stay . 
but they ' re going to kill her ! 
she ' s rich . 
yes . rich , powerful ! listen , if you were to rescue her , the reward would be . . . 
well more wealth that you can imagine . 
you ' ll get it ! 
you will . . . 
all right . 
uh . . . threepio , hand me those binders there will you ? 
okay . now , i ' m going to put these on you . 
okay . han , you put these on . 
lock the door ! 
i can ' t see a thing in this helmet . 
why didn ' t you say so before ? 
prisoner transfer from block one - one - three - eight . 
he ' s going to pull us all apart . 
what ? oh . . . the uniform . i ' m luke skywalker . i ' m here to rescue you . 
i ' m here to rescue you . i ' ve got your r2 unit . i ' m here with ben kenobi . 
come on ! 
see - threepio ! see - threepio ! 
we ' ve been cut off ! are there any other ways out of the cell bay ? . . . what was that ? i didn ' t copy ! 
there isn ' t any other way out . 
well , i didn ' t . . . 
no ! wait ! 
will you forget it ? i already tried it . it ' s magnetically sealed ! 
there ' s something alive in here ! 
something just moves past my leg ! look ! did you see that ? 
help ! 
blast it , will you ! my gun ' s jammed . 
anywhere ! oh ! ! 
i don ' t know , it just let go of me and disappeared . . . 
the walls are moving ! 
wait a minute ! 
threepio ! come in threepio ! threepio ! where could he be ? 
threepio ! come in , threepio ! threepio ! 
where could he be ? threepio ! threepio , will you come in ? 
threepio ! 
shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level . 
we ' re all right . you did great . 
hey . . . hey , open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number . . . where are we ? 
well , let ' s get moving ! 
see - threepio , do you copy ? 
we ' re right above you . stand by . 
where are you going ? come back ! 
what good will it do us if he gets himself killed ? come on ! 
that oughta hold it for a while . 
oh , i think i just blasted it . 
here , hold this . 
is the ship all right ? 
look ! 
no ! 
i can ' t believe he ' s gone . 
they ' re coming in too fast ! 
got him ! i got him ! 
i care ! 
so . . . what do you think of her , han ? 
no ! 
it ' s not impossible . i used to bull ' s - eye womp rats in my t - sixteen back home . they ' re not much bigger than two meters . 
so . . . you got your reward and you ' re just leaving then ? 
all right . well , take care of yourself , han . i guess that ' s what you ' re best at , isn ' t it ? 
oh , it ' s han ! i don ' t know , i really thought he ' d change his mind . 
i only wish ben were here . 
biggs ! of course , i ' ll be up there with you ! listen , have i got some stories to tell . . . 
thank you , sir . i ' ll try . 
i told you i ' d make it someday , biggs . 
red five standing by . 
this is red five ; i ' m going in ! 
i got a little cooked , but i ' m okay . 
i ' m on my way in now . . . 
i ' m on it . 
my scope ' s negative . i don ' t see anything . 
hang on , biggs , i ' m coming in . 
got him ! 
i ' m hit , but not bad . 
artoo , see what you can do with it . hang on back there . 
i can ' t shake him ! 
blast it ! wedge where are you ? 
thanks , wedge . 
no sign of any . . . wait ! 
 . . . oh - five ; we ' ll cover for you . 
it ' ll be just like beggar ' s canyon back home . 
watch yourself ! increase speed full throttle ! 
you worry about those fighters ! i ' ll worry about the tower ! 
you can ' t do any more good back there ! 
artoo , try and increase the power ! 
i ' ve lost artoo ! 
oh , no ! 
he ' ll be all right . 
hey , steady girl . what ' s the matter ? you smell something ? 
aaargh ! 
dagobah system ? 
dagobah system . . . 
dagobah . . . 
thanks to you . 
well , forget the heavy equipment . there ' s plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports . 
thanks . 
chewie , take care of yourself , okay ? 
yeah . 
you , too . 
just like new , dack . how about you ? 
steady , dack . attack pattern delta . go now ! 
all right , i ' m coming in . 
that armor ' s too strong for blasters . 
just hang on . hang on , dack . get ready to fire that tow cable . 
dack ? dack ! 
artoo ! get her ready for takeoff . 
don ' t worry , artoo . we ' re going , we ' re going . 
no , artoo , you stay put . i ' ll have a look around . 
artoo ? 
artoo ! where are you ? 
artoo ! you be more careful . 
artoo - that way ! 
artoo ! 
oh , no ! are you all right ? come on . you ' re lucky you don ' t taste very good . anything broken ? 
if you ' re saying coming here was a bad idea , i ' m beginning to agree with you . oh , artoo , what are we doing here ? it ' s like . . . something out of a dream , or , i don ' t know . maybe i ' m just going crazy . 
ready for some power ? okay . let ' s see now . put that in there . there you go . 
still . . . there ' s something familiar about this place . i feel like . . . i don ' t know . . . 
i ' m looking for someone . 
i don ' t think so . i ' m looking for a great warrior . 
put that down . hey ! that ' s my dinner ! 
listen , friend , we didn ' t mean to land in that puddle , and if we could get our ship out , we would , but we can ' t , so why don ' t you just . . . 
hey , you could have broken this . don ' t do that . ohhh . . . you ' re making a mess . hey , give me that ! 
i don ' t want your help . i want my lamp back . i ' ll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole . 
oh , artoo , let him have it ! 
artoo ! 
i ' m not looking for a friend . i ' m looking for a jedi master . 
you know him ? 
stay here and watch after the camp , artoo . 
look , i ' m sure it ' s delicious . i just don ' t understand why we can ' t see yoda now . 
how far away is yoda ? will it take us long to get there ? 
mostly because of my father , i guess . 
yoda ! i am ready . i . . . ben ! i can be a jedi . ben , tell him i ' m ready . 
but i ' ve learned so much . 
i won ' t fail you - i ' m not afraid . 
vader . is the dark side stronger ? 
but how am i to know the good side from the bad ? 
but tell me why i can ' t . . . 
there ' s something not right here . 
i feel cold , death . 
what ' s in there ? 
oh , no . we ' ll never get it out now . 
master , moving stones around is one thing . this is totally different . 
i don ' t . . . i don ' t believe it . 
han ! leia ! 
i saw . . . i saw a city in the clouds . 
they were in pain . 
future ? will they die ? 
i ' ve got to go to them . 
i can ' t keep the vision out of my head . they ' re my friends . i ' ve got to help them . 
but han and leia will die if i don ' t . 
but i can help them ! i feel the force ! 
but i ' ve learned so much since then . master yoda , i promise to return and finish what i ' ve begun . you have my word . 
and that is why i have to go . 
you won ' t . 
and sacrifice han and leia ? 
i will . and i ' ll return . i promise . 
you ' ll find i ' m full of surprises . 
no ! 
i ' ll never join you ! 
he told me enough ! it was you who killed him . 
no . no . that ' s not true ! that ' s impossible ! 
no ! no ! no ! 
ben . . . ben , please ! 
ben . leia ! 
hear me ! leia ! 
oh , leia . 
father . 
it ' s vader . 
ben , why didn ' t you tell me ? 
ow ! 
 . . . both are hardworking and will serve you well . 
i must speak with jabba . 
you will take me to jabba now ! 
you serve your master well . 
and you will be rewarded . 
i must be allowed to speak . 
you will bring captain solo and the wookiee to me . 
nevertheless , i ' m taking captain solo and his friends . you can either profit by this . . . or be destroyed ! it ' s your choice . but i warn you not to underestimate my powers . 
han ! 
are you all right ? 
wouldn ' t miss it . 
the same as always . 
you should have bargained , jabba . that ' s the last mistake you ' ll ever make . 
there ' s nothing to see . i used to live here , you know . 
just stick close to chewie and lando . i ' ve taken care of everything . 
jabba ! this is your last chance . free us or die . 
easy , chewie . 
get the gun ! point it at the deck ! 
point it at the deck ! 
come on ! 
let ' s go ! and don ' t forget the droids . 
i had a lot of help . think nothing of it . 
i ' ll see you back at the fleet . 
i have a promise i have to keep first . . . to an old friend . 
i ' ll meet you back at the fleet . 
i will . 
that ' s right , artoo . we ' re going to the dagobah system . i have a promise to keep . . . to an old friend . 
no . . . of course not . 
master yoda , you can ' t die . 
but i need your help . i ' ve come back to complete the training . 
then i am a jedi ? 
master yoda . . . is darth vader my father ? 
yoda , i must know . 
yes . 
unfortunate that i know the truth ? 
well , i ' m sorry . 
i can ' t do it , artoo . i can ' t go on alone . 
obi - wan ! why didn ' t you tell me ? 
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father . 
a certain point of view ! 
there ' s still good in him . 
i can ' t do it , ben . 
i tried to stop him once . i couldn ' t do it . 
but i had to help my friends . 
i found out darth vader was my father . 
i can ' t kill my own father . 
yoda spoke of another . 
but i have no sister . 
leia ! leia ' s my sister . 
but you can ' t let her get involved now , ben . vader will destroy her . 
ask me again sometime . 
hi , han . . . chewie . 
yeah , she ' s comin ' up . 
all set . 
vader ' s on that ship . 
i ' m endangering the mission . i shouldn ' t have come . 
quietly , there might be more of them out there . 
great . come on . 
i see them . wait , leia ! 
quick ! jam their comlink . center switch ! 
move closer ! 
get alongside that one ! 
get him ! 
keep on that one ! i ' ll take these two ! 
what ? she didn ' t come back ? 
we got separated . 
hey , we better go look for her . 
come on , artoo . we ' ll need your scanners . 
there ' s two more wrecked speeders back there . and i found this . 
chewie , wa - wait ! don ' t ! 
han , don ' t . it ' ll be all right . 
chewie , give ' em your crossbow . 
do you understand anything they ' re saying ? 
threepio , tell them if they don ' t do as you wish , you ' ll become angry and use your magic . 
just tell them . 
thanks , threepio . 
leia . . . do you remember your mother ? your real mother ? 
what do you remember ? 
tell me . 
i have no memory of my mother . i never knew her . 
vader is here . . . now , on this moon . 
he ' s my father . 
there ' s more . it won ' t be easy for you to hear it , but you must . if i don ' t make it back , you ' re the only hope for the alliance . 
you ' re wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you ' ll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it . . . i have it . . . and . . . my sister has it . 
yes . it ' s you leia . 
then you know why i have to face him . 
no , you don ' t . you ' ve always been strong . 
because . . . there is good in him . i ' ve felt it . he won ' t turn me over to the emperor . i can save him . i can turn him back to the good side . i have to try . 
i know , father . 
it is the name of your true self . you ' ve only forgotten . i know there is good in you . the emperor hasn ' t driven it from you fully . that is why you couldn ' t destroy me . that ' s why you won ' t bring me to your emperor now . 
come with me . 
i will not turn . . . and you ' ll be forced to kill me . 
search your feelings , father . you can ' t do this . i feel the conflict within you . let go of your hate . 
then my father is truly dead . 
you ' re gravely mistaken . you won ' t convert me as you did my father . 
you ' re wrong . soon i ' ll be dead . . . and you with me . 
your overconfidence is your weakness . 
no ! 
i will not fight you , father . 
your thoughts betray you , father . i feel the good in you . . . the conflict . 
you couldn ' t bring yourself to kill me before , and i don ' t believe you ' ll destroy me now . 
i will not fight you . 
never - r - r ! 
never ! i ' ll never turn to the dark side . you ' ve failed , your highness . i am a jedi , like my father before me . 
father , please . help me . 
no . you ' re coming with me . i can ' t leave you here . i ' ve got to save you . 
father . . . i won ' t leave you .
