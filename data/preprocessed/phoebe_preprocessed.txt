don ' t make me do this again , i don ' t like my voice like this . 
ok , who wants to hear something ironic ? 
they found their bodies the very next day , they found their bodies the very next . . . la la la la la la . 
this is so great . 
i mean , well , ' cause when i was growing up , you know my dad left , and my mother died , and my stepfather went to jail , so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one . and here ' s this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they ' re fighting over who gets to love it the most . and it ' s not even born yet . it ' s just , it ' s just the luckiest baby in the whole world . i ' m sorry , you were fighting . 
hi , i ' m ben . i ' m hospital worker ben . it ' s ben . . . to the rescue ! 
well , susan , i see what appears to be a dark vent . wait . yes , it is in fact a dark vent . 
you guys , he ' s beautiful ! 
susan , he looks just like you . 
oh , look , look , he ' s closing his eyes . look , he ' s opening his eyes . 
oh , look , he ' s closing his eyes again . 
oh , look , he ' s got ross ' s haircut ! 
wow , ooh , you ' re gonna be making money hand over fist ! 
we ' ve got the ground - up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys , ew . . . 
so how are things going with you two ? is she becoming your special someone ? 
hey . 
how long did you think this barbecue was gonna last ? 
jeez , you say one thing , and . . . 
oh , let me see ! 
hi , ben . i ' m your father . i am . . . the head . aaaaaahhhh . . . . alright , this barbecue is gonna be very fun . 
oh , well , see , there ' s this guy she met at the . . . 
so you do know who he is ! sorry . 
oh , hey , y ' know what ? tell them that bone story . 
oh , it ' s dr . seuss ! 
remembered what ? 
oh , it ' s so pretty . this must have cost him a fortune . 
i know . this is really , really huge . 
nuh - uh . i don ' t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again . 
here , look , alright , does this help ? 
yeah , but , y ' know , it ' s . . . it would be like starting on the fifteenth date . 
no , i mean , i mean , when you ' re at the fifteenth date , y ' know , you ' re already in a very relationshippy place . y ' know , it ' s . . . you ' re committed . 
well , i mean , then what happens if it doesn ' t work out ? 
maybe there ' s someone else . 
ok , so this is pretty much what ' s happened so far . ross was in love with rachel since , you know , forever , but every time he tried to tell her , something kind of got in the way , like cats , and italian guys . finally chandler was like " forget about her " but when ross was in china on his dig , chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel . she was like , " oh my god . " so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back , but what she didn ' t know was , that ross was getting off the plane with another woman . uh - oh ! so , that ' s pretty much everything you need to know . but , enough about us . so , how ' ve you been ? 
oh my god . this is huge . this is bigger than huge . this is like , all right , what ' s bigger than huge ? 
yes . 
 ' cause , you know , if you don ' t look good , we don ' t look good . i love that voice . 
oh , ok . how , it ' s been so long since you ' ve had sex , you ' re wondering if they ' ve changed it ? 
all right , so what were you thinking ? 
ohh ! no . 
because , i ' m just , i ' m incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak . 
i know i ' m not , but you are , and i was trying to spare your feelings . 
i ' m still on " no . " 
what ' s goin ' on ? 
ewww ! 
where ? 
ok , you ' re gonna have to not touch my ass . 
all right . ok , but , but ! you have to promise that you will not be all like control - y and bossy and monica about it . 
all right . now some of you are gonna get cut , and some of you aren ' t . but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing . 
all right , that ' s it , i quit . 
yeah , but this isn ' t the face of a person who trusts a person . ok , this is the face of a person who , you know , doesn ' t trust a person . 
would you relax ? i know what i am doing . this is how he wears it . 
demi moore . 
well , he was a he in arthur , and in ten . 
oh . oh ! 
oh my god ! 
oh my god ! i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry . which one ' s demi moore ? 
oh , she ' s got gorgeous hair . 
it ' s too soon to tell . she ' s resting , which is a good sign . 
i ' m not gonna lie to you , ross , it doesn ' t look good . i put a clip on one side , which seems to have stopped the curling . 
your hair looks too good , i think it would upset her . ross , why don ' t you come on in . 
thank you . 
oh yeah ! oh , i can do that . 
you wanna do it right now ? 
ok , i just wanna be really sure this time . andie mcdowell ' s the girl from four weddings and a funeral , right ? 
oh , yeah . ok , thank you . 
oh , look at these ! hey , ben . just do it . oh my god , oh , ok , was that too much pressure for him ? 
i can ' t , i have to take my grandmother to the vet . 
monica , she will kill you . she will kill you like a dog in the street . 
woof , woof . 
what ? 
oh , all right . what did i have ? 
oh , no wonder i don ' t feel full . 
i went shopping with monica all day , and i had a salad . 
um , we went shopping for um , for , fur . 
yes , and then i realized i ' m against that , and uh , so then we bought some , uh , boobs . 
bras ! we bought bras ! we bought bras . 
ben , dinner ! 
duh , i think i know how to heat breast milk . ok . 
i licked my arm , what ? 
so ? 
you won ' t even taste it ? 
not even if you just pretend that it ' s milk ? 
oh , i tasted ben ' s milk , and ross freaked out . 
come on . it doesn ' t taste bad . 
you guys , um i know that this really doesn ' t have anything to do with me , but um i love you guys too . oh , i really needed that . 
wait , wait , wait , wait ! 
you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason . 
i miss janice though . " hello , chandler bing . " 
ok , it ' s very faint , but i can still sense him in the building . go into the light , mr . heckles ! 
i ' m sorry , but sometimes they need help . that ' s fine . go ahead and scoff . you know , there ' re a lot of things that i don ' t believe in , but that doesn ' t mean they ' re not true . 
like crop circles , or the bermuda triangle , or evolution ? 
nah . not really . 
i don ' t know , it ' s just , you know . . . monkeys , darwin , you know , it ' s a , it ' s a nice story , i just think it ' s a little too easy . 
yeah , i just don ' t buy it . 
ok , don ' t get me started on gravity . 
well , it ' s not so much that you know , like i don ' t believe in it , you know , it ' s just . . . i don ' t know , lately i get the feeling that i ' m not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed . 
just don ' t . look at this funky shirt ! 
really ? you can actually see it ? 
see , i didn ' t know that . 
huh . so now , the real question is , who put those fossils there , and why ? 
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts . 
look , can ' t we just say that you believe in something , and i don ' t . 
what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you ? no , what ' s that all about ? i think , i think maybe it ' s time you put ross under the microscope . 
he ' s even kind of cute . 
i ' d call that excessive . 
janice ? you called janice ? 
uh - oh . it ' s scary scientist man . 
ok , look , before you even start , i ' m not denying evolution , ok , i ' m just saying that it ' s one of the possibilities . 
ok , ross , could you just open your mind like this much , ok ? wasn ' t there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat ? and , up until like what , 50 years ago , you all thought the atom was the smallest thing , until you split it open , and this like , whole mess of crap came out . now , are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can ' t admit that there ' s a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this ? 
i can ' t believe you caved . 
you just abandoned your whole belief system . i mean , before , i didn ' t agree with you , but at least i respected you . how , how , how are you going to go into work tomorrow ? how , how are you going to face the other science guys ? how , how are you going to face yourself ? oh ! that was fun . so who ' s hungry ? 
ok , i didn ' t see it , because i was putting on my jacket , but i uh want to believe you . 
uh huh . why is that ? 
chandler , you called janice ! that ' s how much you wanted to be with someone ! 
you ' re there ! 
well , i mean , i ' m not married married , ya know , he ' s just a friend and he ' s gay and he ' s just from canada and he just needed a green card . 
i ' m sorry monica but i knew if i told you , you ' d get really , like , judgemental and you would not approve . 
ok , i wasn ' t in love with him and i was just helping out a friend . 
i might have . 
oh , c ' mon , like you tell me everything . 
oh , i don ' t know . umm , how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby out on the terrace . 
you have a third nipple ? 
yeah , is there a hair on it ? 
um , i ' m gonna go meet duncan , he ' s skating tonight at the garden , he ' s in the capades . 
ok , no . for your information i ' m going to see him so i can put all those feeling behind me . ok , and the reason i ' m dressed like this is because i think it ' s nice to look nice for your gay husband .

i , i don ' t know what to say . i mean , you know , you ' re married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says , ' oh , i ' m not gay . ' 
why couldn ' t you have just figured this out six years ago ? 
so , um , have you told your parents ?

so your brother ' s straigh huh ? seriously .

can you believe how much this is gonna cost ? 
yes , yes , and it ' s , and we always have to go to , you know , someplace nice , you know ? god , and it ' s not like we can say anything about it , ' cause , like this birthday thing , it ' s for ross .

eight dollars and 27 cents . but not really , ' cause i put in the first two , just to , you know , get the ball rolling , and to make myself feel better . 
no . this whole like playing - for - money thing is so not good for me . you know , i don ' t know , when i sang " su - su - suicide " , i got a dollar seventy - five . but then , " smelly cat " , i got 25 cents and a condom . so you know , now i just feel really bad for smelly cat . 
it ' s not even that . i used to do my songs because it made me happy , but now it ' s like , it ' s just all about the money .

no , i felt it on my hip . you could tell . 
ooh , oh , rachel , don ' t look . 
so , i figured it out . 
why scott doesn ' t want to sleep with me . it ' s ' cause i ' m not sexy enough . 
really ? that ' s so sweet . i mean , i ' m officially offended but , sweet . 
you ' re right , you ' re right . ah , you are so yumm . 
hey joey . 
how come you ' re watching a rabbi play electric guitar ? 
so , scott asked me to come over for lunch today and i did . 
and we did . 
yay me . 
well , i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on . 
he said that , um , he understands how sex can be like , a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all , y ' know , like , ' ohh , is he gonna call me the next day ' and , y ' know , ' where is this going ' and , ya know , blah - la - la - la - la . so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious . 
yeah , so i said , " ok , relax please , " y ' know , i mean , sex can be just about two people right there in the moment , y ' know , it ' s , if he wants to see me again he can call and if not , that ' s fine too . so after a looooot of talking . . . i convinced him . 
um - hum . 
ok , all right . we want to hear everything . monica , get the wine and unplug the phone . rachel , does this end well or do we need to get tissues ? 
oh . 
ok , all right , let ' s hear about the kiss . was it like , was it like a soft brush against your lips ? or was it like a , you know , a " i gotta have you now " kind of thing ? 
ok , so , ok , was he holding you ? or was his hand like on your back ? 
wow . what are you gonna use it for ? 
hey , oh , so , um . . . how ' d you make out last night ? 
oh , well , actually . 
ok , all right . 
ok , um , hi , hello , hi , ok , so , um , this is a song about a love triangle between three people that i made up . um , it ' s called , um , " two of them kissed last night " . 
there was a girl , we ' ll call her betty , and a guy let ' s call him neil . now i can ' t stress this point too strongly , this story isn ' t real . now our neil must decide , who will be the girl that he casts aside . will betty be the one who he loves truly ? or will it be the one who we ' ll call ju . . . loolie ? he must decide , he must decide , even though i made him up , he must decide ! 
it ' s not , it ' s not very thanksgiving - y . 
what makes it pilgrim ? 
hey . 
no offense , but that sounds nothing like her . 
oh , oh sweet lord ! this is what evil must taste like ! 
i . . . i cannot believe ross even made this list . what a dinkus .

yeah , by the way , good luck in your next life as a dung beetle . 
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh . ugly naked guy is decorating his tree . oh my god , you should see the size of his christmas balls .

that ' s him . 
yes , hi , mr . adelman . thanks for meeting me .

ok , ben , this is the part where ernie buries bert in the sand and can ' t find him . now , i ' ve looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again . but , ok , before that happens , there ' s some pretty rough goin ' for a while but i think we can handle it . and , there ' s just the alphabet but we know that ends well so . ok , here we go . 
oh , i ' m so glad you ' re here .

all i got was a lousy key chain ! and by that time i was living in a box . i didn ' t have keys ! 
this isn ' t a good deed , you just wanted to get on tv ! this is totally selfish .

right . 
i cannot believe i can ' t find a selfless good deed ! y ' know that old guy that lives next to me ? well , i snuck over there and - and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop . but he caught me and force - fed me cider and cookies . then i felt wonderful . that old jackass ! 
i will find a selfless good deed ! ' cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right ! 
ooh - ohh ! 
why ? 
yeah . 
yeah , but you ' ve known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life . 
hey joey , i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed . i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me . 
well , it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends . the bee is happy and i am definitely not . 
aw , dammit ! 
ooh , it ' s not a toy . 
hi joey . 
i would like to make a pledge . i would like to donate $ 200 . 
oh , i ' m still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who ' s moms didn ' t kill themselves , so by supporting them , i ' m doing a good thing , but i ' m not happy about it . so there , a selfless good deed . 
no , it sucks . i was saving up to buy a hamster . 
yeah , not the one i had my eye on . 
oh , look - look , joey ' s on tv ! isn ' t that great ? my pledge got joey on tv ! oh that makes me feel - oh no !

well y ' know every time that they say that like they ' re doing laundry we ' ll just give them a bunch of laundry to do . 
no ! you don ' t have to do anything ! just don ' t tell them that we know ! 
well , you could use your position y ' know as the roommate . 
and then . i would use y ' know the strongest tool at my disposal . my sexuality . 
okay , watch , learn , and don ' t eat my cookie . 
hey ! ooh , wow that jacket looks great on you !

you ' re - you ' re what ? ! 
i just - i thought you guys were doing it , i didn ' t know you were in love ! 
god ! 
ooh , i ' ll go in on that with you ! i couldn ' t think of anything . 
hey ! i brought you some house warming gifts . 
yeah . salt , so your life always has flavor . 
bread , so you never go hungry . 
and a scented candle for the bathroom , because well , y ' know . 
yeah ! 
mr . president . 
yeah . i really like his glasses . 
oh , hi ross ! 
oh , i thought this was your party and it turns out it ' s a party for howard . he ' s just the sweetest little man ! 
yeah , uh - huh , a 100 dollars . 
yeah , but they didn ' t ask me ! y ' know ? this way i ' m just y ' know , the exotic , generous stranger . that ' s always fun to be . 
no i ' m not . no ! if anything i ' m making you look better ! they ' ll see you talking to me and that ' s - - i ' m a hit ! 
hey ! 
yeah , okay , my bad . 
that ' s what i ' m saying . 
ooh . 
no ! no ! i ' m talking you up to people . just give it a little time , all right ? relax , get something to eat ! okay ? 
oh , i was telling them about you and emily . y ' know , try to get some sympathy . 
but somehow you came off as the bad guy . 
yeah , i think i told it wrong . y ' know , we should talk about that because i don ' t totally understand what happened there . 
oh , okay , see ? things are looking up already ! 
all right , everyone calm down ! everyone calm down ! i have something that i would like to say ! who here likes ross ? of course you don ' t like him ! he - he didn ' t give you any money , he raised his own hand when i asked , " who hear likes ross , " and he ' s wearing two nametags ! i - i ' ll be honest with you guys , when i first met ross i didn ' t like him at all ! but then once i got to know him i saw that he ' s really sweet and caring and very generous . i mean , all i ' m saying is don ' t judge ross before you get to know him all right ? i mean , i like all you guys now , but when i first meet you y ' know kurt , i thought , y ' know abrasive drunk , umm lola , mind numbingly stupid ! and okay , you guys gold - digger , cradle robbing perv ! so , i think you all know what i mean . 
obviously i didn ' t think they were gonna start throwing things . i just thought if i kept insulting everyone , you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero . 
aw , and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week . 
all right . hold on . i got it . nickel ! how much more do we need ? 
okay , dime ! you guys should probably keep talking ; this could take a while . oh no , wait ! look it ! whoa ! oh my god , this is a police badge ! 
yeah , i should probably take it back . ooh , but you know what ? while i ' m at the police station , i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever , so this could be her year ! 
oh . oh ! ma ' am ? excuse me , ma ' am ? 
you can ' t put your cigarette out on a tree ! 
no but you shouldn ' t ! don ' t ever do that again . 
hold it ! n . y . p . d ! freeze punk ! 
yeah that ' s right you are so busted . book ' em . 
save it red ! unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer , you apologize to the tree . 
you apologize to the tree right now or i am calling for backup . backup ! backup ! ! 
okay , cancel backup ! cancel backup ! 
 . . . so this guy was all and i ' m all , buffay , homicide . it was just so cool ! 
i know but i ' m having so much fun doing good deeds . 
you could get arrested , right now ! all right , yeah , i gotta take it back . i ' m totally drunk with power . 
hey . 
excuse me , is this your car ? 
well i don ' t think it ' s very nice of you to park here , y ' know you ' re blocking the entrance . 
well , it ' s a problem for me , which means it ' s a problem for you ' cause i ' m a cop . 
ohh , no . oh okay , so you ' re a cop which means you can park anywhere , ' cause i know that ' cause i ' m a cop too . so , all right , keep up the good work . 10 - 4 . 
i - i ' m with the umm , the 57th . 
i ' m in vice . yeah , in fact i ' m undercover right now . i ' m a whore . 
umm , do you know , umm sipowicz ? 
yeah , big guy , kinda bald . 
don ' t try to call him or anything , ' cause he ' s not there , he ' s out . his umm , his partner just died . 
i - i sure will , take care . 
oh . 
ooh , god , it ' s him ! it ' s that cop ! god , i can ' t believe it ! he found me ! 
well , if i ' m going down , i ' m taking you with me . harboring a fugitive ? that ' s one to three years minimum . good luck chandler . okay , you can arrest me . fine . but you ' ll never make it stick and you know it ! 
yep ! as long as you understand that i ' m going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he ' ll make you look like a fool . a fool ! 
i would love it if i weren ' t here !

oh , look ! look ! look ! 
i was in charge of cups .

don ' t get me started on that . 
sounds like somebody wants to be mr . pizza delivery girl . 
okay pepperoni , pepperoni , pepperoni , okay ross , i know she ' s pretty and you love her , but is she stupid ? ! she forgot my vegetarian !

this is terrible , what are you going to do ? 
that ' s not good .

make sure you check chandler ' s jewelry box . 
okay , we have like ten minutes . do you want me to get into that now ? !

ohh ! i did not get that . 
did you find it ? 
okay , those are my sunglasses , you borrowed them from me . 
what are we going to do ? ! 
all right well , we ' re just gonna have to tell monica , that ' s all .

no , i like him a lot but i don ' t think i ' m ready for this ! 
i don ' t know . i ' ll just handle it - i ' ll ask you to talk to him ! 
because you are so afraid of commitment ! you talk to him , make him scared like you ! make him a . . . man ! 
hmm , did you talk to gary about the moving in thing ? 
what ? ! 
you are useless ! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do ! the one thing ! and you can ' t even do that right ! god ! 
ohh ! ! god ! ooh ! get out of here , good for nothing . 
yeah ! okay . 
thanks ! okay . 
yeah ? 
uh - hmm . 
no that ' s not true . if you ' re not moving forward , you ' re just staying still . and staying still is good . watch this . 
yeah ? 
that is so sweet . but don ' t you think it ' s a little too soon ? i mean there ' s so much we don ' t know about each other . 
i just - i don ' t want us to jump into something we ' re not ready for . 
i really don ' t want to mess up what we have . i ' m just - i ' m worried it ' s gonna be a big mistake . 
which is why my answer is yes ! 
uh - huh ! i ' m so . . . happy . 
we ' re moving in together ! isn ' t it great ! yay ! 
i know , i ' m so excited ! 
well , you ' re not more excited than i am ! no way ! i ' m the most excited ! 
okay , yeah , i ' ll see you later ! don ' t forget about the moving in ! 
i couldn ' t tell him no . he got so sad . maybe it ' ll be all right . i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus , think of all the money i ' ll save on stamps . 
no , i just heard when people live together , they split the cost of stamps . don ' t they ? 
oh , i ' m sorry , the oven mitts really freaked me out . 
no , nothing . 
yeah . 
no , as soon as something opens up we ' ll move right in . unless it doesn ' t have a pool , i need a pool .

guys , i ' m happy too . 
wow ! big day huh ? people moving in , people getting annulled . . . 
hmm , something bad to tell rachel . . . bad news for rachel , what could that be ? ! 
ross , it ' s not that big a deal ! so you ' ll been divorced three times , you ' ll still have a life , you ' ll go on dates . . . 
ross , you ' re being ridiculous ! okay ? you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces ! 
y ' know that ' s really fair . y ' know ? most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60 . ross , nobody cares about this except you ! this - this embarrassment thing is all in your head ! here , i ' ll show you ! come here . 
hi ! hi ! listen , my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time , but wouldn ' t you date him ? 
okay , so what do you think ladies ? who wouldn ' t be interested ? who wouldn ' t want to date him ? 
okay , what about you ? wouldn ' t you want a date ? 
whatever ! what about you meg ? 
she said , " he ' s obviously still in love with this rachel girl . " 
well , i thought you loved her when you - when you married her . 
hey ! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani ! ! 
yes , and now he ' s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her . i must say , " well done ! " bravo meg . 
okay , bye ! 
so ? did you get the annulment ? 
i knew it ! because you love rachel . 
yeah , complicated ' cause of the love . 
i ' ve never been more convinced of your love for her . 
oh we do , but not just yet . 
okay umm , well , first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way . yeah . but it won ' t work out . 
i know . then , i ' m gonna marry chandler for the money and you ' ll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids . 
but then we ditch those two and that ' s when we get married . we ' ll have chandler ' s money and rachel ' s kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel ' s drinking problem . 
i don ' t want to go into the whole thing , but umm , we have words and i kill him . 
hey ! check it out ! this is unbelievable ! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes ! 
uh - huh , what ? 
oh ! 
well , that would be great but then what do we do about denise ? 
my roommate . 
yes , denise . denise ! 
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say . i talk about her all the time ! denise ! ! ! ! ! 
hey . 
so , what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ? 
you didn ' t tell her did you ? 
of course not , because you ' re in love with her . 
what do you mean , comforted her ? 
ah - ha ! a classic sign of love , the hug ! 
yeah , not in your case lovey loverson . 
okay , just tell me this , did you or did you not smell her hair ? 
ninety percent of a women ' s pheromones come out the top of her head ! that ' s why , that ' s why women are shorter . so that men will fall in love when they hug them ! oh come on ross , you ' re a scientist . 
okay , whatever you say . but just be careful , all right ? rachel ' s not in the same place you are . 
okay , i didn ' t understand that , but y ' know , maybe that ' s ' cause you were speaking the secret language of love ! 
shhhhhh ! i ' m swamped right now . 
umm , i ' m trying to move that pencil . 
it worked ! 
wait , no , look at this ! " two bedroom , two bath , must be non - smoker , satan worshipers okay . . . " oh , yeah , but it ' s on the ground floor . 
i saw it . 
umm , i ' m talking about that which you already know but won ' t admit . you love her again ; you re - love her ! 
i can ' t believe you won ' t just admit it ! okay , just promise me that you won ' t do anything stupid . 
what ? ! 
wow ! i ' m - i ' m so happy for you guys . this is so - so , not stupid . 
no . no , i won ' t . but i should tell you this , this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise . she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn ' t love her , but he really did , and it just blew up ! and that ' s how she ended up living with me ! okay , that ' s a lie . 
i found you in my bed ! how ' d you whined up there ? you are a mystery ! little black curly hair ! little black curly hair ! little black , little black , little black , little black , little black curly hair . . . . . . . . . . . . 
now if you want to receive e - mails about my upcoming shows , then please give me money so i can buy a computer . 
yes . 
ross , i know what you ' re thinking . 
that she ' s gonna move in with you and maybe then she ' ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you ' re already married , she ' ll just be happy . y ' know ? you ' re just , you ' re very sad . 
what ? ! !

well , you know that psychic i see ? 
well , she told me that i ' m gonna die this week , so i ' m kinda bummed about that . 
yeah , and i know you guys don ' t know a lot about psychic readings , but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get . 
i don ' t - she said y ' know that i ' d have triplets ! but she also said one of them would be black . 
no , ' cause she didn ' t tell me i was gonna die until the very end of the session , and i was not gonna waste a whole another hour there ! i mean i ' ve only got a week left , y ' know ? i ' ve really gotta start living now ! , leans back , and starts reading . ) 
oh , this is it . this what ' s gonna kill me . 
hey ! 
ugh , it ' s so exhausting waiting for death . ohh , by the way , do you think you could - 
i was preparing you for my - didn ' t you think i was dead ? did that not come off ? 
yeah , thanks . and listen , can you do me a favor ? could you just umm , wake me up in a couple hours , y ' know if you can .

no , we can go together ! just don ' t wait too long though , okay ? ' cause i ' m outta here sometime before friday . 
no - no , it ' ll be fun ! we can come back and we can haunt these guys ! 
hey !

because my psychic is dead ! she must ' ve read the cards wrong ! 
eh , better her than me ! hey , let ' s bake cookies !

maybe you could be my roommate ! 
yeah ! 
umm , she said she ' d be back december 26th . 
i ' m doing okay . i think it ' s going well . do you think they ' re having fun ? am i talking to fast ? 
na - uh , no , we are all responsible for our own babies . 
that sounds really great , but maybe you should be in charge of wiping . 
yeah ? well this is not what i ordered . 
hey ! 
i don ' t know why i was so nervous about this . and i don ' t know why frank and alice are always complaining . this is so easy . 
no chandler , they can swallow one of those little parts ! and also , look at his smooth area , that ' s just gonna mess them up . 
what ? ! 
oh , look at little leslie stretching in her sleep . 
oh , i can still do that . 
how did that happen ? ! ! 
yeah , but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun . 
what ? ! no , you can ' t , you can ' t leave me here with them ! we ' re baby - sitting ! 
but you - you can ' t leave me with them ! we - we ' re a team ! we ' re playing a zone ! they ' re gonna triple team me ! 
but no , because a doctor won ' t be able to help him , it ' s just gonna y ' know naturally pass through his system in like seven years . 
i ' m pretty sure it ' s gun . 
a real man wouldn ' t just run to the hospital ! no ! what would , what would krog do ? 
me taking care of you is no problem , huh ? you guys feel safe . right ? okay , i ' m gonna take that spit bubble as , " yeah , i do ! " okay , after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie , i ' ll set you up with a clean one . okay , i ' m sorry . i didn ' t mean to scare you . i just have to clean that up . okay ? ' cause let ' s face it , we ' re at monica ' s . i broke it . all right . well , that ' s just the way that goes . okay , good . why are there only two of you ? where is leslie ? well , you can ' t answer . leslie ? where are you leslie ? leslie , now would be a good time for your first words ! well , look at you ! hey ! you are a little bit mischievous ! my gosh ! oh , you ' re a lot mischievous ! well , it ' ll dry . okay , you sit with your brother and sister now - who aren ' t there ! 
how do you feel ? 
okay , so i totally took care of the babies all by myself ! i fed ' em , bathed ' em , and put ' em to bed . 
i know , the babies are asleep . 
i did it ! i took care of the babies all by myself ! 
so is joey going to have to give up the apartment ? 
well , how much do you think he needs ? 
why don ' t you hire him as an actor ? you could have him dress up and put on little skits . whatever you want . 
and also , my birthday .

you guys , we said we were gonna have fun ! come on , hey , remember the time . . . you don ' t remember ? 
well , this doesn ' t have to be so sad though . y ' know ? maybe instead of just thinking about how much you ' re gonna miss each other , you should like think of the things you ' re not gonna miss .

okay , you guys . you guys i think i know what ' s going on here . okay , you guys . . . stop ! ! i know that , i know that you ' re acting mad because you think that it ' ll make it easier to leave . but deep down you ' re still really sad . deep - deep down .

rachel . 
i don ' t know . me neither .

oh , sly . 
okay , i got a good one . okay , umm , what is she ? like 12 ? 
hey ! 
okay , i just thought of the perfect guy for rachel to take to her thing . 
oh that ' s good , i guess she ' ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo . 
 ' cause that ' s just your taste . 
oh yeah ? 
my guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work . and , he has one of these 
a chin dimple ! 
have you seen your guy ' s body ? 
well my guy is spectacular . okay ? he ' s a massage client and one time umm , when he was on the table , i looked at it . and i mean all of it .

i know . 
oh , chandler funny ? 
my guy is well read . 
my guy has great teeth ! 
hey ! 
what did you do on yours ? 
rachel , what the hell is this ? ! 
you ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own ! 
yeah and i - i found you one too who is not a weirdo . 
so , sebastian , do you do any volunteer work ? 
no reason , it ' s just i know a single guy that cares about other people . 
well , so do a lot of people . 
yeah , y ' know what i noticed rachel ? he scares easy . is that the kind of guy you ' d like to take to a ball ? " hey sebastian , would you like to dance ? " " uhh , okay - i gotta go ! " 
yeah ! what have you got to lose ? y ' know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy . 
okay sure ! 
ooh , technically you owe me $ 600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions . 
okay . 
ross , you can ' t tell her not to go . you just started dating . 
nothing , you just have to be cool with it . 
this is patrick .

i ' ll be waiting . 
no , i ' m just deciding which one to use - i ' m gonna start writing another book ! 
well , if you must know i have written 14 books . and as i am the only one who has read them , i can tell you that they all have been very well received . 
oh , rachel and i have appointments to get our hair cut . 
i want to see what he wants first . 
you ' re elizabeth ' s father , huh ? i can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness . 
yeah . not looking for dates . 
you guys , i ' m sorry , could you please talk a little slower ? 
yeah , it ' s about relationships . y ' know ? the traps , the pitfalls , what not to do , keep going . this stuff is great ! 
and how none of it matters when the people really love each other . and how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it ' s a compliment . 
hey ! 
well , why don ' t you just get him fired ? 
 " you wish . " 
i ' m not writing about you ! i ' m writing about other people . 
marcia and chester . 
i see what you ' re doing ! 
ooh , i have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter ! 
hi ! 
i know what time you said . 
well actually , i know what time chester and marcia said . 
quite an interesting turn of events , suddenly it ' s my book to the rescue , huh ? ooh , very interesting . yeah , well this certainly clears things up . 
i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book . 
thanks ! so are you . 
mon . . . marcia and chester are planning on seeing a movie on sunday night . marcia thinks they ' re supposed to meet at six , chester thinks it ' s at seven . 
that ' s right . 
marcia and chester are mad at phyllis . 
hi , you guys . 
well it ' s just - it ' s one of those situations that i just hate . y ' know ? a massage client gave me three tickets to the helmet - pelts exhibit at the morgan chase museum . 
no ! no ! it ' s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us ! 
okay that ' s so generous ! 
great ! okay then it ' s just us girls ! 
yeah . 
it ' s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches . 
oh , this is so exciting ! you get your picture back up on the wall of fame ! eek ! 
ohh , okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to matt lauer . look at him , smiling at me . yeah i know ; we ' d be great together ! 
so umm , now do you have any of matt lauer ' s clothes here ? maybe ? just ones that haven ' t been cleaned yet ? 
hey , and then lunch . 
oh wow . what , do you think maybe he ' s gonna tell you that he ' s gay ? 
no reason ! that would just be a really big surprise , right ? 
yeah , but there ' s a two - year wait . and then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place . that ' s four years . chandler ' s not gonna wait that long . he ' s gonna find somebody else , y ' know ? someone , someone who did put their name on the list . 
me too ! 
i don ' t know , i don ' t have anyone right now . y ' know ? 
don ' t feel too sorry for me . at least my boyfriend isn ' t gay . 
don ' t even get me started on yours ! 
yeah ? 
no ! why ? 
well for the regular guy , it ' s bad , but chandler , oh dear god ! 
what are you gonna do ? 
rachel said that ! 
oh ! here it is ! ooh , joey ! why did you sign it , " son of a bitch ? " 
okay , maybe ask this guy . 
well , what did he do ? 
joey ! 
well , we should go . 
hey , did she buy it ? 
so did heldi show you the place ? 
i can ' t believe you ' re gonna ask monica to marry you ! 
now , have you told anyone else ? 
you told me . 
yeah well , once again not knocking pays off . i only wish you hadn ' t been on the toilet . 
hey ! so chandler , wanna go to the coffeehouse ? 
yeah , coffeehouse . 
so how are things going with paul ? 
that ' s easy ! you just have to think of him as a - as a jar of pickles that won ' t open . 
no that ' s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone . 
watch this . 
hi paul ! 
so how are things going with you ? 
yeah ! that was so weird , huh ? 
i didn ' t do it ! it was chandler ! he ' s . . . he ' s mad at you ! 
please , i think you know why . 
come on ross , you ' re a paleontologist , dig a little deeper . 
do you think that ' s something that he ' d be mad at you for ? 
well then i think that ' s it . 
oh , if that ' s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table . 
okay , so maybe you don ' t get her a ring . maybe you - maybe you do something different . y ' know ? maybe you get her an engagement bracelet , y ' know ? or an engagement tiara ? or - ooh ! an engagement revolutionary war musket ! ( picks one up from the display in the corner . 
huh ? can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry ? 
wait a minute , no , this is , this is the reason you brought me . okay ? i know how to haggle . so let me handle this from here on out . 
or not , whatever . 
chandler , i - i will handle this ! how much is it ? 
we will give you $ 10 . 
we stand firm at $ 10 . 
okay . listen , i ' m sorry about before . do you have anything her for $ 10 . 
i ' ll give you $ 1 for them . 
okay umm , i ' d also like to try on the tiara . oh yeah . okay . what do you think , too much ? 
okay . then , take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again . something ' s missing . it ' s not . . . okay oh , let me see the ring my friend picked out . 
oh my god ! ! no ! what ? ! help me ! let me out ! now ! 
chandler , i found the perfect ring . 
oh my god chandler , the one you picked is gone . it ' s over ! 
some guy bought it . i ' m sorry . i tired to stop it but they put me in jail ! 
the little jail between the doors ! 
i know , i ' m sorry ! but y ' know , this ring is better ! monica never even saw the other ring . 
maybe it was the guy . 
hey . 
it ' s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring ! it ' s a beautiful ring ! 
okay . there may be a way that we can get the other ring back . ' cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose . so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something . 
well you certainly can ' t give her that stupid gumball ring . 
there he is ! 
wow ! you ' re good ! after this , we should solve crimes . 
oh , okay . excuse me sir ? could you come with me please ? you have a phone call . 
it is your office . 
john ? 
here he is . 
wow ! i would trade . 
yeah , do you want to break a dying woman ' s heart ? 
yes , and it is my dying wish to have that ring . see , if i ' m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity . . . 
hi . 
what ? 
oh i know , i helped pick out the ring . 
yeah ! 
if she says no , can i have the ring ? 
if ! 
hi monica . 
it ' s gone . 
we ' re practically kissing . 
open bar ? 
i can do that for the kids . 
y ' know , you are 12 years older than her . 
oh ! oop ! 
here . 
so now what ' s going on here ? 
no , i know what a silent is i meant , what ' s going on with your hair ? 
no ! it ' s nice ! 
oh , hi . 
hey you guys ! look ! 
i got me some drinks ! 
open bar ! 
you just can ' t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can ' t you ? 
forget her ! you enjoy this ! ! 
well , just buy the damn boat ! 
i ' m just helping the kids ! 
because the more i drink , the less there is for the kids to drink . 
oh , okay . 
it ' s a trip for two ! excuse me . excuse me , is the person who won the paris trip at this table ? 
oh , en chante . 
ohh , let me see it ! let me see your hand ! 
i wanna see what ' s in your hand . i wanna see the trash . 
eww ! oh , it ' s all dirty . you should throw this out . 
what happened ? 
well , a palm reader , a manicurist , a hand doctor . . . 
good one ! yeah . 
look , she only suspects something okay ? she doesn ' t know for sure , so just throw her off the track . 
yeah ! yeah ! convince her that - that you ' re scared of commitment ! convince her that you ' re a little coward ! 
no , you ' re too late ! ! ! she already took out the trash ! ! ! 
i know , they ' re gonna be so happy together . 
not that often ! 
me too ! so happy for them ! 
oh no ! no god , definitely not jealous ! 
totally . i ' m like 90 / 10 . 
definitely ! 
what do you mean ? 
you mean a backup ? 
yeah , yeah i got that . 
hm - mmm . 
joey . 
yeah ! 
yeah , i locked him years ago ! 
yep , we shook on it . yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal . 
ohh , yeah . i think his exact words were . . . 
well hey , it ' s just a backup . 
of course i can ! it ' s just good sense to backup your backup ! look , i ' ve already lost chandler ! 
i don ' t - look i don ' t know what you ' re complaining about now ? you were both aware of the situation ! 
okay , this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we ' re married ! 
all right well let ' s see , ross is a good father , but joey has a boat - this is hard ! 
no wait ! just - okay - just wait ! you guys ! wait you guys ! don ' t make any rash decisions , okay ? just remember my promise , when we get married , three times a week . 
i ' m talking about massages . 
good ! 
left ! thank you . 
ross ! 
yeah absolutely ! 
oh no wait no , this is wrong ! ross isn ' t here ! 
oh no , let her stay out there . it ' s sweet . 
so have you decided on a band for the wedding ? because , y ' know , i ' m kinda musical . 
well speaking of chiming in , remember the time you burned down my apartment ? 
oh , 19 ! we thought you said 90 ! 
oh honey no , you ate it all . 
check it out . okay , i can play this when the guests are coming in . okay . " first time i met chandler , i thought he was gay . but here i am singing on his wedding day ! " 
if you would ' ve let me finish , it goes on to say that he ' s probably not gay . 
i ' m sorry , but i just wrote the best dance song for your wedding . check this out . 
really ? ! oh that ' s so exciting ! thank you ! thanks mon ! oh but mon , if you touch my guitar again i ' ll have to pound on you for a little bit . 
okay . 
you guys kissed ! ! ! ! ! what does this mean ? ! ! are you , are you getting back together ? ! can i sing at your wedding ? 
what a great night , chandler can ' t do it , these guys kissed . . . 
well yeah , that and chandler ' s problem . 
okay , so the plaza ! okay , we ' ll get us some mai thai ' s , maybe no more for you though . 
why ? ! 
yeah ? okay , i think i ' ll play it at the wedding . 
well , i don ' t think monica is gonna take this away . 
would she ? 
okay , you said i could sing at your wedding so , i ' m just gonna need a small deposit . 
y ' know , just some good faith money to hold the date . 
oh , i see . 
y ' know , i don ' t really their permission . 
yeah ! and if you wanna look 19 , then you . . . you gotta do something about your eyes . 
they give you away ! there ' s just - there ' s just too much wisdom in there . just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes . 
maybe just 10 minutes for you . 
 " whenever i get married , guess who won ' t get to sing ? somebody named geller ! and somebody else named bing ! " 
 " we thought phoebe would leave , but she just stayed and stayed . that ' s right , i ' m here all night , and chandler will never get l . . . " 
oh thank you . 
now . . . " who will perform the ceremony ! who will perform the cer - - oh - oh ! all right , i ' ll pound on him in the morning . 
it starts ? 
that is so smart ! break it off . break it off now . 
hey ! ross ! 
i need to talk to you , it ' s pretty urgent . it ' s about monica and chandler . 
well , umm , not much . but , i was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy , y ' know ? so , could i just move in with you for a couple days ? 
nothing - why ? ! 
oh yeah it is ! i ' m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes . 
oh , i ' m sorry . i ' m so rude . does anyone want to come to the movies ? 
oh ross , hi . 
i ' m sorry , i ' m with a client right now . 
okay , let ' s talk outside . 
what ' s the big deal ? i did it at monica and chandler ' s ! 
okay , well ross , what is this really about ? 
okay , i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments . i just don ' t know what the big deal is ! 
my god ! what did you order ? ! 
look , why don ' t you just pay for it yourself ? 
wow ! hello , mr . chandler . 
wow , money and a firm hand . finally a chandler i can get on board with . 
ross ! how could you do that to an old man ? ! 
my massage client , arthur ? his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon . 
he said you poked at him with wooden spoons . 
well , he ' s never coming back ! okay ? you just cost me eight dollars a week ! 
oh , it ' s my fault ? ! you didn ' t have to massage him ! you could ' ve sent him away ! you could ' ve not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back ! 
so what do you guys want for an engagement present ? 
not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist . 
you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe ? 
you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that i would never let out of our family ? 
break my heart - oh , all right . 
if you don ' t sail your boat , what do you do on it ? 
your own boat ? 
i just went to my old apartment to get you the - the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up ! 
because i ' m normal ! that was the one legacy my grandmother left me , and i know you wanted it as an engagement present . 
okay , here i wish you health and happiness . 
see no - no , i made a batch and i froze it , and this is the only one left . 
why not ? 
really ? ! 
you do ? 
that and arrogance . 
i can ' t believe that ! now the only thing left of my grandmother ' s legacy is this crumb . i wish you a long and happy marriage . 
come on , it ' s not that big a deal ! 
oh , what was that for ? like a bake sale ? 
yeah , but not as good as batch 17 . 
are there anymore from the good batch ? ' cause we could just work off of those . 
y ' know , i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we ' re trying to figure out her recipe . i bet she ' s l - l - lookin ' up at us and smiling right now . 
oh yeah - no , she was really nice to me , but she ' s in hell for sure . 
oh no - no , no , i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body . and that ' s not happening ' til october 15th , 2032 . 
that ' s what you think .

his first big kid ' s bike , this is so exciting ! 
i never had a bike of my own . 
well , we didn ' t have a lot of money . but the girl across the street had the best bike ! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips , and - and - and a bell and this big , white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on . 
no ! but she gave me the box that it came in . it had a picture of the bike on the front . so i would sit on it and my step - dad would drag me around the backyard . 
not really , i got to drag him around too ! 
yeah , and they ' ve been coming by all day . they love it ! 
sure ! 
oh my god ross ! !

oh and chandler ' s about to cry . 
oh hi ! 
ohh , uh - huh so much !

wait ! this seat is really uncomfortable ! yeah , maybe before we start we should just get another one . perhaps , like an airplane seat - or a beanbag chair ! 
why ? why do i have to learn ? 
what kind of an emergency ? 
okay , i would ring the bell to distract him and then i would knock the gun out of his hand with a chinese throwing star .

oh my god ! i ' m sorry , too soon . you go . 
good for you ! 
oh my god ! that guy at the counter is totally checking you out ! 
go for it . 
i ' m just saying , get his number just in case . but no chandler is in an accident and can ' t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill . 
i did , but that was really fun . 
oh hey ! 
oh , great ! we couldn ' t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y ' know , he ' d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck . 
all i could think of was y ' know , " is he gonna kiss me ? is he gonna kiss me ? " 
i ' m a lady monica , i don ' t kiss and tell . but this hickey speaks for itself . 
i just like him so much that i just feel like i ' ve had 10 drinks today and i ' ve only had six . 
you sound like a guy . 
you ' ll have a last kiss . 
okay bye . 
bye ! we said good - bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love . 
i miss you too ! ! ! ! 
no . why ? 
okay , don ' t sweat it . chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system . that guy ' s cute . 
no that is the last thing you want to do ! 
because you ' re marrying him ! 
all right , i ' ve never been engaged and i ' ve never really been married , but i can only tell you what my mother told me . whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship , do not communicate them to your husband . 
that is correct ! yes , you ' re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight . 
yes ! 
oh my god ! you ' re right ! go ! go tell chandler ! hurry before it ' s too late ! wait no ! does this also mean putting out doesn ' t get you love ? 
rach ? 
oh . it ' s just so unexpected ! i . . . i uh . . . boy i ' ll tell you it ' s just such an honor to be nominated for a nobel prize and y ' know to win one for a massage . especially after having just won a tony award for best actress in . . .

i ' m wearing his briefs right now . 
i think so too . and that little flap ? great for holding my lipstick . 
and ! y ' know what jake says ? that women ' s underwear is actually more comfortable . and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin . 
there is nothing wrong with jake ! okay ? he is all man ! i ' m thinking even more than you . 
i ' m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women ' s underwear ! i don ' t think you could ever do that . 
okay whatever . 
hey ! 
wow ! nice ! manly and also kind of a slut . 
uh - huh . 
huh . 
that ' s great joe ! 
uh - huh . 
hmm ? 
i think it ' s important that you do .

yeah , i understand . 
why ? ! what ' s happening to the coffee house ? ! oh ! 
what are they ? 
that play ? 
the movie ? 
ohh ! 
oh , yeah ! back then y ' know , we called the great war . it really was ! 
congratulations ! 
go ahead . 
yes ! very good . 
ross , please ! my make - up ! 
what ' s up ? tell monica i ' m sorry . tell her yourself ! 
oh my god ! chandler just left though ! 
or maybe he - he was writing to tell her that - that he ' s changed his name , y ' know ? tell monica i ' m sorry . 
don ' t be so negative ! good god ! isn ' t it possible that sorry is sitting in there right now ? ! 
okay but if you don ' t find him and bring him back , i am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass ! 
oh man . 
okay . well there ' s one down . 
y ' know she might not even notice he ' s gone . 
shhh ! stop it ! stop it rachel ! you can ' t do this here ! 
yeah , but you ' ve got to pull yourself together ! monica can ' t see you like this ! then she ' ll know something ' s wrong ! 
yeah . oh , that ' s gone too . this is monica ' s bathroom right ? ! 
no - no ! i - i . . . i found one . 
sure . do you need some floss ? 
oh here ' s a whole bunch . 
oh my god ! 
there was a pregnancy test in the garbage , and it ' s positive . monica ' s pregnant . so i guess she won ' t be totally alone . 
i know ! monica ' s gonna have a baby ! hey , can this count as her something new ? 
hey , do you think this is why chandler took off ? 
oh god , this is turning into the worst wedding day ever ! the bride is pregnant . the groom is missing . and i ' m still holding this . 
right . 
yeah , okay . hey , wait . do you know what kind of birth control she was using ? 
just for the future , this is hardly a commercial for it . 
you told them he was missing ? 
okay . i ' m going with you . 
ross , you ' re tired . you ' ve been looking all night . and clearly you suck at this . 
okay . wait , do you know how you ' re going to stall her ? 
all right . good luck . 
oh my god ! is that him ? 
he could be in disguise , y ' know . 
what the hell are you doing ? ! 
why not ? ! 
but look chandler , right now , no one has a lower opinion of you than i do . but i totally believe you can do this . 
found the vest ! i mean we ' re gonna have to keep an eye on it , y ' know make sure we don ' t lose it again . . . 
so - so you two were married huh ? what happened ? you just drift apart ? 
oh my god monica ! 
wait ! maybe , maybe you ' re overreacting ! you do that y ' know . 
okay . oh but don ' t tell them monica ' s pregnant because , they frown on that . 
okay . 
yeah ! 
what ' s going on ? 
oh my god ! why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk ? ! 
hey ! oh ! 
you know ? ! 
what ? you ' ll hi - ya ? 
cigarettes ? ! ! 
well you obviously didn ' t see chucky 3 . 
what ? 
oh and they ' re gonna have a baby . 
okay . hey mon , why did you tell the guys you weren ' t pregnant ? 
we found your test in the trash , if you ' re not pregnant - - it ' s because i am . 
yes , i . . . i am with child . and i didn ' t want to say anything because it ' s your day ; i didn ' t want to steal your thunder . 
i can ' t say . 
i can ' t say because he ' s famous . 
okay , okay . it ' s james brolin . james brolin is the father of my baby . 
what ? ! well he never said that to me ! 
how about just the bridemaids ? 
it is . 
oh my god ! 
so instead you told me monica was pregnant . 
sneaky . 
uh - hmm . 
oh , i know . i could only think of two names , him and ed begley jr . and then i remembered he ' s gay . 
really ? ! 
so , are you ready to talk about it ? 
now ? 
okay , we ' ll talk about something else then . 
who ' s the father ? ! 
yeah . that ' s fine . that ' s fair . is it tag ? 
okay , i ' m sorry . i ' ll stop . 
is it ross ? it ' s ross isn ' t it - oh my god , it ' s joey ! 
ah - hah ! at least we know it ' s a him . 
well , i just got off the phone with my lover , james brolin . . . 
yes , and apparently he is married to some singer , but he said he would leave her for me . and i said , " james , james brolin , are you sure ? " james brolin said . . . 
what ? ! why bother ? 
calm down . maybe you ' re not pregnant . 
when i got pregnant with the triplets , i took that test like three times just to make sure . 
i ' m - i ' m just saying , don ' t freak out until you ' re a hundred percent sure . 
i ' ll run out and get you one . 
oh no , she won ' t tell us . 
see ? this is why you register . 
30 seconds . 
it ' s time . 
okay . 
umm , it ' s negative . 
it ' s negative . 
here . 
no , it ' s positive . 
it ' s - it ' s not negative , it ' s positive . 
well yeah , i lied before . 
now you know how you really feel about it . 
with who ? 
oh ! joey uh , were you in our room last night ? 
hey ! 
are you gonna open the presents without chandler ? 
a little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman . 
ohhh ! my god ! for tiny salt ! 
oh yeah . 
okay . 
well i guess it ' s okay to open one more if it ' s part of a set . y ' know , it ' s probably this one . 
yeah that ' s right chandler does still think i ' m pregnant . he hasn ' t asked me how i ' m feeling or offered to carry my bags . boy , i feel bad for the woman who ends up with him . after you of course . 
ooh , is it someone in this building ? is it that tall guy from the first floor ? 
what ? ! i think he ' s cute . 
believe me i ' m trying . 
yeah . you ' re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever . you ' re like ed mcmahon except without the big check , or the raw sexual magnetism . 
pretty big ? it ' s huge ! god , this guy doesn ' t have a clue ! he ' s just walking down the street thinking , ' i had sex with rachel green . i rock ! ' then bam ! he ' s a father and everything ' s different . 
okay . then he still has this huge decision to make . now he ' s walking around thinking , ' do i want to be a dad ? ' and then bam ! 
i don ' t . he got . . . he - he - he - he ' s hit by a bus . 
oh yeah . that ' s me . 
yes . yes i am . oh my god , i ' m gonna have a baby ! 
you don ' t know him . it ' s not important . he wants nothing to do with me or the baby . 
david lynn . 
oh some guy from my gym . a little annoying . 
hey ! ooh , did you do it yet ? 
oh , well what are you doing here ? are you about to do it ? is it gunther ? 
thank god , ' cause that hair on a baby . . . 
why not ?

we don ' t know . 
who ? who is it ? 
was that story over ? 
oh my god ! i know who the father is . . . 
look , i feel really bad about how i freaked you out before , so i called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him . go ! 
i may play the fool at times , but i ' m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won ' t quit . i believe this belongs to the father of your baby . 
uh - huh . now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the band - aid off . what to you want to do ? 
really ? are you sure ? 
okay , sorry . yeah . 
rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm , i believe that this is your red sweater .

of course i do ! and i ' m gonna give it back to you as soon as they ' re done with it at the key shining place . 
well why don ' t you use your key ? 
oh ! we could have done that . 
oh great ! and listen , could you do us a favor and not tell chandler and monica about this ? ' cause y ' know umm , they don ' t - they don ' t have any kids of their own and - and this door was like a child to them . 
oh no .

i can ' t believe he taped the two of them having sex ! 
greg and jenny ? 
you got fake numbered . 
excuse me , i don ' t want greg and jenny ' s rejects . 
hmm , i wonder why . pervert ! 
that ' s like the pervert motto ! yeah ! yeah ! they have you raise your right hand , put your left hand down your pants , and repeat that ! 
regina philange . 
no ! not the sex part , just the stuff leading up to it . 
okay fine ! fine ! we ' ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ' who came onto who , ' thing to rest ! come on now , think ! ! 
you ' re gonna get pregnant . 
oh , you came on to ross ! 
hey ! 
dinner was good ! 
i ' m just saying hi ! now i ' m gonna go ! 
oh , well hello there . 
i didn ' t see this on the menu . 
oh , so you ' re monica ' s boss ? 
oh ! i sous stand . 
oh you . . . you made pesto ? 
would you say your pesto is the best - o ? 
i made it myself . 
well , it ' s no pesto . 
ooh monica ! 
oh my god ! i had the best time with tim last night . he is so sweet ! oh , i can ' t wait to get sous - neath him . 
but why ? ! 
well maybe he was just nervous , y ' know you can be very intimidating . and besides i ' ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two . 
but monica , he loves his job so much ! can you just give him another chance ? please ? 
that ' s fair ! thank you so much . thanks . oops , it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too . 
love it ! 
hey ! 
but . . . 
okay . okay , but you can ' t fire him today . 
because i ' m dumping him today . 
he is sweet . he ' s too sweet . he calls me all the time . " so did - did you get home from work okay ? " " did - did you get out of the shower okay ? " 
then he comes over ! " i ' m so worried about you . " uck ! be a man ! 
you can ' t fire him and dump him the same day , he ' ll kill himself . 
are you kidding ? ! another week with that sip , i ' ll kill myself ! 
okay . but the question is who ' s gonna go first . ' cause whoever goes second is the bitch . 
come on ! the boss that fires a guy that ' s just been dumped , bitch ! and the woman who dumps a guy that ' s just been fired , blond bitch ! 
all right , that makes sense . ugh . but - screw you i ' m going first ! 
hi .

thank you .

two weeks ? that ' s it ? 
oh really ?

hmm ? 
oh .

okay i can ' t let you do this ! she ' s lying to you . 
she is lying ! and i bet i can prove it . excuse me . okay . okay . yeah - not a prayer chain , but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan . okay , here ' s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress ! not a teacher , a waitress . all right , here ' s her driver license , this oughta be good , she always lies about this . how old did she say she was ?

joey ! those are my maternity pants ! 
is there anything we can do for you ? 
how can you let him talk to your crotch like that ?

okay . 
hey ross ! doesn ' t ben go to the smithfield day school ? 
sting has a son that goes there too ! 
you knew this and you never said anything ? ! with all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us ? !

rossss can ! 
rosss can ! give me the tickets ! ross can give me the tickets ! !

now ben , sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside , but they have famous fathers . 
him you ' re friends with . 
yes ! yes you can , i ' m looking for jack ' s parents . 
uh - huh , i ' m with ben . 
i am one of ben ' s mothers . i ' m a lesbian . it was , it was difficult coming out to my parents . 
oh . 
ah ! okay so that would make me susan . 
yeah ! let ' s do that ! ! that - that sounds good . we should sit down and talk , just me , my lover carol , and the stings . umm , how - how will i get in touch with them ? 
uh - huh . uh - huh . umm , could - could i get a copy of that ? ' cause carol threw it out , she lost ours . she ' s such a scatterbrain , but man what a hot piece of ass .

unless ! unless umm , okay i - i would be willing to go to the concert , umm , all the while thinking about the children of course . 
oh , thank you . four would be great . 
oh good ! then you ' re in luck ! ben ' s not my son ! 
the police ? here ? a reunion ? ! 
oh my god ! i do love you ! how did you do it ? ! 
oo , where are the seats ? 
okay , now would you say that that ' s more than 50 yards away from sting , his wife , or a member of his family ? 
then that ' s not breaking the law ! i ' m there ! 
yeah ? 
he ' s awfully short and i think he ' s talking to himself . and to be completely honest , he ' s not that good in bed . 
wait a second ! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy , right ? 
this is completely normal , around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy . 
oh absolutely yeah ! oh and keep in mind , now , i was carrying triplets so in , y ' know , medical terms i was - i was thrice as randy .

yeah ? 
don ' t worry , we ' ll find you someone else . 
i ' m so sorry . 
i don ' t know , they both want to live in a house of cheese ! i don ' t know how you fight that . 
okay , so when you ' re done with your tea i ' ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune . 
oh yeah , i ' ve done it for years . i actually stopped because i was so accurate . y ' know , and - and y ' know , one of the great joys of life is it ' s - it ' s wondrous unpredictability . y ' know ? and also tea tends to give me the trots . 
okay . ooh , i see a ladder . which can mean either a promotion or a violent death . 
uh - hmm . uh - hmm , who ' s next ? 
okay . umm , oh ! okay , i see a circle . 
oh ! which can either mean you ' re having a baby or you ' re gonna make a scientific discovery ! 
umm . . . wow , all right . wow ! yay ! ooh , i ' m gonna meet a guy ! and really soon ! and he ' s gonna be the man of my dreams . probably not the guy i had a dream about last night . 
oh wait a second you guys . . . for the last couple weeks i ' ve been that guy everywhere i go . we take the same bus . we go to the same bookstore , the same dry cleaners ; maybe he ' s the tea guy . 
oh hello . 
oh jim , jim nelson i ' m phoebe , phoebe buffay . we certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately .

hey ! 
everybody , this is parker , parker this is . . . 
hey ! 
i ' ll go with you 
were you guys making fun of parker ?

well , so what i like him ! do i make fun of the people you ' ve dated ? tag , janice , mona ? no , because friends don ' t do that . but , do you want my opinion ? do you want it ? ' cause in my opinion , your collective dating record reads like the who ' s who of human crap . 
no , i ' m fine . i ' m great . i ' m with you . 
hm huh , yeah . 
no , that ' s not necessary . 
no , actually i don ' t eat . . .

i ' m sorry , for the last time , why aren ' t you two together again ? no , i know . i know , because you ' re not in that place . which would be fine , except you totally are . 
yeah that ' s true . yeah , you love her . you always have . you have a child together . there is no right answer .

have umm , have you thought anymore about you and rachel ? 
yay ! it ' s so exciting ! wow , you could ' ve done that with us there .

oh please ! just before when you were asleep in the lounge ! that armenian family was watching you instead of the tv . oh , that reminds me . that mr . hasmeje still has my gameboy . 
hey ! 
are you all right ? 
oh my god ! he did it ? 
are you kidding ? i ' m like the one who talked him into it . i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group . 
i just talked him into it , don ' t tell me i have to do you too . the puppet master gets tired people . 
why ? ! you two are so meant to be together , everybody thinks so . 
especially ross ! 
there he goes , your fiance . 
although he does play with himself in his sleep . 
oh hey ! wait up ! 
congratulations ! i didn ' t want to say anything in front of joey ' cause i didn ' t know if he knew yet . 
no ! no , that you and rachel are engaged ! 
oh , it ' s a secret . oh goodie ! yes ! we haven ' t done the secret thing in a long time . 
are you lying ? is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor ? 
all right , me too . should we wake her up ? 
and so engaged . 
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring ? y ' know ross doctors are supposed to be smart . 
really ? 
so whose ring is it ? 
is it an engagement ring ? 
but you didn ' t give it to her ? 
but you were going to propose ? 
huh , i might be losing interest in this . 
oh , what beautiful lukewarm sentiment . 
no ! no , she said you actually proposed to her . 
no they ran out of " it ' s a girl " but i can fix this one , see ? 
look at all the stuff people sent ! 
she ' s just so cute ! i just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy .

you know that ' s . . . that ' s her . 
oh no , rach , no no , you know you ' re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby . 
i can say i told you so but she ' s kinda doing that for me . 
it really does . . . how long do you think we have to stay ? 
well , alright , we already tried feeding her , changing her , burping her , oh try this one ! go back in time and listen to phoebe ! 
yeah , no kidding , this just proves no good can come from having sex with ross ! 
alright you guys , we can ' t turn on each other , okay ? that ' s just what she wants .

what ? ! 
do you not know each other ? 
mike , let me ask you something . how many sisters does joey have ? 
joey , why did you set me up with a stranger ? 
you are unbelievable ! i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you , you know . mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose . 
who are you kidding ? you just find some guy off the street for me ? oh god ! this is humiliating ! 
i ' m out of here . 
sure . 
why did you go along with that ? 
that ' s true . well , is anything you told me about yourself true ? 
prove it . 
that wouldn ' t stand in the way of a true pianist . 
you are really good ! i play a little guitar myself . 
uhuh . 
well , like acoustic folksy stuff . you know ? but right now i ' m working on a couple ' iron maiden ' covers . 
it ' s okay . go ahead , ask me out . 
oh , you just caught me off guard ! yeah , that would be nice . 
bye chandler . 
okay , bye - bye ! good trip ! 
oh hey ross oh i ' m so glad someone ' s here could you zip me up ? 
thank you . can you believe no - one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me ? 
oh umm mike ' s picking me up for a date . 
oh i dunno i dunno , you know i mean i like him but am i ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market . 
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen . 
i wouldn ' t say never , you know there ' s that guy well what about ok well there ' s gotta be someone . 
oh my god you ' re right . 
i can ' t believe i never realized this before , i ' m in my thirty ' s and never been in a long - term relationship oh my god what ' s wrong with me . 
i wanna get married . 
least you ' ve been married , oh my god ! i wanna trade lives with ross . 
nothing , i ' m excited about our date , mike this is ross geller this is mike haaaaa . 
uh huh how do i look . 
no . 
well it was awful every time i thought about what you said i started crying . 
would you call this girl ? thanks - fo - r - a - love - ly - even - ing . 
well you not what you should feel terrible about , this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny . do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that ? 
it ' s open . 
hey ! mike called were going out again ! yay ! yay ! 
what ? wha - wha - wha - did you do ross ! 
what ! 
what ! why ? 
if you hadn ' t just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now ! 
i ' m not going along with some lie you made ross , no i ' m just gonna be honest with him . 
yeah i ' ve nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven ' t been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month . ok i haven ' t had a real boyfriend you know if he can ' t handle that he can leave . which he will and that ' s ok . so i ' ll just be alone forever you know alright i ' ll be . it ' ll be fine . it ' ll be fine . i ' ll go walking tours with widows and lesbians . oh . 
ok . 
uh huh yeah there ' s just something umm , there ' s something you should know vicrum just called . 
 . and i said vicrum you can ' t just call every time you get lonely you know , you , you gave up that right when you slept with rachel . 
yeah well yeah you know emma ' s birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee . 
i know but he call ' s and my heart goes to him . you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer . 
oh . 
ok i can ' t do this . 
well there is no vicrum , ross made him up because i never really have been in a long - term relationship , i ' ve never lived with a guy , and i ' ve never even celebrated an anniversary so . if that ' s too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand . in fact i ' ll close my eye ' s make it less awkward you kissed me . 
so you don ' t think i ' m a total freak . 
i guess so , can i . can i think it ' s cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm , be a little concerned about the magic markers . 
you know maybe this is a wake up call , about your whole dating attitude . your in your thirty ' s and you ' ve never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship , here you go from woman to woman , meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn ' t tern into anything serious . 
oh hey you guys , i couldn ' t get a reservation for the night of my birthday , so we have to do dinner thursday night instead . 
so ? 
no ! it ' s my first birthday with a boyfriend , and he has to work . uch , i get mad at him , but i think it ' s a little to soon to show my true colors .

i know ! evil ! and . . . and . . . and . . . i like mike so much , you know . it ' s just going really well . oh my god ! 
uhuh . . . yeah . . . ! , you know . and given my life long search for irony , you can imagine how happy i am . 
i mean i guess , i just have to . . . tell david that nothing can happen between us . unless i don ' t . . . you know , complicated moral situation , no right , no wrong . . . 
okay , i knew i should have had this conversation with joey . 
hey ! 
okay . 
no , but it sounds like it was fricken funny . . .

i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry . 
i am happy . 
well . . . but david , just . . . i just want you to know that . . . that . . . you know . . . telling you this . . . is one of the hardest things i ' ve ever had to do . 
of course , yeah . you know , a kiss on the cheek wouldn ' t be totally inappropriate . . . 
i mean . . . 
yeah ? 
well , if that ' s what they do in minsk . . . in new york . . . it ' s . . . 
hmmm . . . no , no . . . no , i can ' t do this . it ' s bad .

oh no , no , no , no , no , no . don ' t get me wrong . no , he ' s not in like a sissy way . no , no , no . . . when he gets going , he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave . . . 
 . . . and then it goes back to the chorus . . . smelly cat , sme - lly ca - t / i - t ' s not your fau - lt . and that ' s the end of the song . . . i realise that you didn ' t ask to hear it , but uhm . . . no - one had spoken in seventeen minutes .

thats a great movie . 
phoe - be . 
there ' s your movie ! later on . monica opens her front door . chandler is sitting in the hallway . 
it ' s ok . i thought of the perfect lie for you . it ' s easy to remember and doesn ' t invite a lot of questions . you weren ' t at the parade because you had a family emergency . 
ooh , what happened ? joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear : oh . . my sister ' s raccoon .

what ? 
oh , whew , no , that ' s bob . 
well not so much a pet as , you know , an occasional visitor who i put food out for , you know . kinda like santa . except santa doesn ' t poop on the plate of cookies . 
what are those ? 
ok , fine , if it means that much to you i ' ll get rid of bob . 
so weird , you think he ' s so gross and you ' re willing to eat his crackers . 
hey mikey . 
what are you doing ? 
to kill bob ? ? 
no , mike , i don ' t want to kill him ! i thought we were just gonna capture him and , and you know , set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl . 
i ' ll find bob , i ' ll get him . bob ? bob ! robert ! oh wait , i think i hear him . oh - oh my god ! bob had babies ! bob ' s a mom ! 
i don ' t know , i kinda like bob for a girl . 
oh my god , we killed bob !

i had to bring them ! we killed their mother , they ' re our responsibility now . you know , they require constant care . you should know that , rachel , you ' re a mother . 
no ! seven rats ! i think we should take them home , we need feed them . 
well i ' m sorry rachel , but i ' m not like you , ok ? not everyone can afford help . 
ok , ok , you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed . 
well , you know what , they ' re our responsibility now . 
mate ? they ' re all brothers and sisters . 
no . wh - get off your sister ! oh my god , what are we gonna do ? we have 7 rats . so what if each of them has 7 rats ? and then each of those have 7 rats ? that ' s like . . . that ' s math i can ' t even do ! what are we gonna do ? 
yeah , ok . i guess you ' re right . allright , so we should just give them away . but to nice families , with children , and reduced fat wheat thins . they ' re bob ' s favorites . 
you must think i ' m crazy . 
good . it ' s just so hard , it ' s hard for me to . . . let them go . i guess it just brings back memories , you know , from . . . when i gave birth to my brother ' s triplets and i had to give them up . i haven ' t told you about that yet , have i ? 
hey . 
listen , i think i ' ve left something here . 
no , but i like it . i think i left one of my rat babies . 
ooh , maybe that ' s him ! 
well it depends . 
on how far along he ' s in the sex change process ! 
your knuckles are kinda hairy too . . . 
wow ! talking about high maintenance . 
i ' m a woman ! 
oh before i forget , are you coming to mike ' s piano bar tonight ? 
but everybody sings . it ' s so much fun ! last time this adorable old man got out there , forgot all of the words , flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage . so funny . 
oh ! what ' s the matter ? are you scared ? you ' re afraid i ' m a better singer ? you ' re afraid i ' m gonna beat you at singing ?

i just wish they ' d realise they should be together . 
i know . they should be a family . they should get married and have more children . 
you know what ? maybe once they start dating , and they see what ' s out there , they ' ll realise how good they are for each other . 
so , what are we gonna do ? are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people ? 
yeah . oh , i know what we can do . we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates , so that they ' ll realise how good they are together . 
yeah , you know what the best part of it is ? i get to do my " plan - laugh . " 
ooh , joey . 
hey . i ' m so excited ; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight .

good for you ! 
ouh . . . 
excuse me , ross , old friends catching up . 
i ' m sorry i have friends outside the six of us . 
well , i ' m not proud of it , but , you know . . . sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i . 
well , ok , i wasn ' t rich like you guys , ok , i didn ' t eat gold and have a flying pony . . . i had a hard life , my mother was killed by a drug dealer . 
she was a drug dealer ! 
okay .

you were ? 
oh my god . 
no . . . actually , you might wanna stay away from jane street . . . that ' s where stabby joe works . 
okay , i think we have a problem here . 
well , uhm , back in my mugging days , you know , i , uhm , i worked st . marc ' s comics . 
well , a pipe was my weapon of choice and , uhm , pre - teen comic book nerds were my meat . 
well , there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said - 
i know . . . i mugged ross ! 
hey , you ! 
hey , how was class ? 
nothing , i really wanna know . 
alright , nothing is worth this . uhm , i have a confession to make . . . uhm , okay , you know , that girl that mugged you when you were a kid . 
you don ' t have to lie anymore , ross , i know that it was a fourteen year - old girl . 
yes , it was . 
 " gimme your money , punk ! " 
yeah , and i ' m so , so sorry , ross , i ' m sorry , but , you know , if you think about it , it ' s kinda neat . i mean , well , it ' s just that i i ' ve always felt kinda like an outsider , you know , the rest of you have these connections that go way back and , you know , now , you and i have . . . have a great one ! 
i know , i ' m sorry , please forgive me . i don ' t know what to say . 
really ? even more humiliating than . 
hey , ross ! i know you ' re still mad at me , but can i just talk to you for a second ? 
i just really wanted to apologize again and . . . and also show you something i think you ' ll find very exciting . 
look , ross , in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell . . . or smoke . anyway , i was looking through it and i found " science boy " 
i can ' t say , i just thought it was really good . . . and . . . maybe would be worth something some day . 
yeah . . . but you should know , i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here . 
you ' re welcome . and thank you for " science boy " . i learned a lot from him . 
why ? ? 
oh . . . you don ' t have to go , i have something that will fit you . 
i want you to stay .

monica slow down ! ok ? i ' m just excited to be living with him . you know i mean , i don ' t know , can i see someday being married to mike ? sure ! yeah . y ' know . . i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way . but do i want that house in connecticut . . . you know . . near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior . . oh my god i do . 
i know ! i guess i am ! oh my god ! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom ! 
yeah ! you bet roomy ! 
oh please , these guys , we haven ' t even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns . 
china patterns ! ! ! ! ! 
oh ! alright . well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it ' s a play on the word roomy . 
oh no ! no no ! not at all . we ' re just moving in right now . see where it goes . 
what do you mean ? 
oh . wow . 
was it really that bad ? 
ok , well that ' s bad . but don ' t you think it might be different with someone else ? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet . except for once in the ocean . 
but it ' s just . . . 
oh ! 
no ! i definitely don ' t wanna get married . no i just wanted to make sure you didn ' t want to too . whew ! coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there ' s gonna be hell to pay mister ! 
yeah i get that . 
hi . 
listen , i wanted to ask you something about marriage . 
no . . . i really wanted to know how you feel about it . 
mike doesn ' t ever wanna get married . 
never . 
i want to , but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn ' t really that big a deal . you know that i won ' t , i won ' t be missing out on anything . that marriage stinks ! 
that ' s not how you really feel is it ? 
seriously ? you divorce - o ? 
it ' s ok that ' s how you feel . 
i do love mike . 
yeah i guess you ' re right . yeah thanks . this helped . thanks . 
it ' s not cooler . 
better . 
oh yeah you were helpful ! yeah , no , thanks you . 
what do you mean ? 
they are awfully boxy . . . 
uh huh . 
just one last time erm . . . the marriage thing . . . there ' s no wiggle room ? none at all ? 
right . except that i do want to get married . 
someday . 
i haven ' t exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it ' s my turn some of the regular stuff . 
because i just didn ' t know how much i wanted it . and i love you , and i wanted to live with you . 
but i don ' t think i can ! it was ok to move in when i didn ' t know what was gonna happen , but i can ' t move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen . 
are you gonna change yours ? 
me neither . i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want . 
i don ' t want it to end either . 
yeah . 
hi . 
breaking up sucks ! oh , i really miss mike ! 
oh god , i tried everything to make myself feel better . i even tried writing a song about it . . . but . . . i can ' t think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh ! ! hey monica , i really need your help getting through this . . . 
well no , when i get to the point where . . . you know . . . i ' m ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike . . . i ' m gonna come to you . 
ok . i mean i know i did the right thing . you know , mike never wants to get married and i shouldn ' t be in a relationship that has no future . . . but . . . pretty soon i ' m gonna miss him so much . i ' m gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that . 
unless . . . maybe it ' s too crazy about this . . . alright so . . . you know , there is no future . . . but that doesn ' t mean we still can ' t have fun . you know what ? forget what i said . 
that was a test and you just failed . 
god , i wish mike were here . 
i gotta call him . just to talk to him , there ' s no harm in that . 
here . 
okay . 
yes . 
yes , it reminds me of a simpler time . 
you can ' t have it . 
no . 
oh yeah . 
damn you monica geller hyphen bing ! 
you know , it ' s a lot less surprising to do that after i ' ve buzzed you into the building . 
those are my shoes . 
monica , i really appreciate you checking in on me , but i ' m actually feeling a lot better . yeah , i just kinda want to be alone right now . 
i ordered chinese food .

yeah well , " excuse me , i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer , but i can ' t see it , i can ' t see it " ! 
well . . . it ' s not about quality . 
well at least all my songs don ' t taste like garlic . yeah , there are other ingredients monica .

ok , ok , how many of you enjoyed the music outside ? ha ! 
ok , well , who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky ? 
ok , well , alright , who thinks the food is fine , the music was fine , but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking ? . 
oh . . . who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend ' s cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great ! 
i ' m sorry too . . . 
yeah ! as long as it ' s free ! food here is ridiculously over - p . . . phoebe : who ' s hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won ' t hate me ?

what ' s up ? hey , rachel ! ! 
no , you can ' t go there ! you know how i feel about these " big massage places " ! they ' re putting people like me out of business ! 
ok , this is not about the money , ok ? it ' s about . . . it ' s about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us . . . the hollow shells . 
well , do you care about friendship ? 
i feel really strongly about this , rachel . please , don ' t use this gift certificate . i ' m asking you as a friend . 
promise ? 
thank you . 
ok . do we have to talk like that then they ' re not around ? oh , no , no ! listen , is there someone who can fill in for me ? 
but that woman can ' t know i work here . she ' s a friend of mine and i made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are . 
 ' cause it ' s good money ! but that doesn ' t change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine ! 
ok , are they listening ?

exactly ! 
i didn ' t even think about that ! aaargh , sexual politics ! ! 
ok , that ' ll be great ! 
oh , i ' ll take some of that . 
no , i know , this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i ' m gonna smell like another guy . yeah .

hey rach , will you come with me to a dressing room ? 
ok ! 
so what were you doing out there , do you not like charlie ? 
why ? 
who else ? 
you like joey ? 
oh my god ! 
uh , wow ! isn ' t it ironic that he liked you and now you like him ? 
oh well , as long as it is under control , you know , you can ' t do anything about it , he ' s already dating her , and she is a nice person , that wouldn ' t be right . 
yeah . 
sure ! 
oh . 
any chance charlie has a deaf twin ? 
well , maybe she didn ' t hear ! ok i ' m gonna go into that dressing room , you stay in here and i ' ll talk and see if you can hear me . 
i didn ' t say anything yet ! 
i ' m rachel . it ' s so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends . 
well , some things are just hard to say to your face . 
ooh ! we have a problem . 
good plan . 
oh ! i ' m sorry rachel , i don ' t have time for your childish games , ok ? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at " who ' s more over who " ! 
are you sure ? because i ' m really dreading going to this party . 
mike knows i ' m coming , and if i don ' t show up he ' ll think it ' s because of him ! and i don ' t want to lose face ! that ' s a very serious thing in my culture . 
you got it ! ok . but not on the wine that you made , ok , because i just don ' t want to go back to the emergency room .

are you kidding ? that ' s what sisters are for . frank jr . : look at them ! aw . i love you so much . oh crap , don ' t wake up , don ' t wake up ! 
hey . 
still , he had to find out sometime . 
hey ! 
oh , you won ' t believe who moved back to town . 
you know what amanda said to me when she got me on the phone ? " oh , so sorry to catch you on your mo - bile ! " if - if you don ' t wanna get me on my mo - bile , don ' t call me on my mo - bile ! " 
oh , i know ! " oh . . . i slept with billy joel " . all right , who hasn ' t ? 
ugh , let ' s just cut her out ! 
cut her out of our lives ! just ignore her calls and dodge her ' till she gets the point ! 
oh , yeah . could be rachel asking if someone could baby - sit again . 
oh , you ' re right ! i was just kidding about rachel . babysitting is a gas ! 
ok , don ' t hold thy breath ! 
why , why , why didn ' t you just say no !

it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy , okay ? you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill . 
you ' re also so generous and kind and scrappy ! 
exactly ! look , no matter what i tried to do , i couldn ' t keep you out of my life . of all the people i have cut out , you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in . 
yeah , you are . and i ' m so glad that you fought your way back in , because i don ' t know what i would do without you . 
yeah , i guess you ' re right . 
oooh , i love family traditions like that . when uhm . . . when ursula and i were kids , on our birthday , our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food ! 
hi ! 
oh , cool ! ! wow , it ' s like a time capsule ! 
oh , just think . . . she ' s gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn ' t even been invented yet ! with friends who right now are just like babies ! and they ' ll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people ! 
yeah ! i wrote emma a song . 
joey , it ' s a birthday party . 
so you ' re gonna . . . hit on her ? 
oh ! 
or you could stick a fork in an apple ! 
separate performances . 
sure , yeah ! 
are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared ? 
that ' s right , i ' ve prepared a song for emma . from my heart to hers . for there ' s no greater gift , than the gift of music . emma ! your name poses a dilemma . ' cause not much else rhymes with emma ! maybe the actor richard crenna , he played the commanding officer in rambo . happy birthday emma ! 
no , of course not ! i also , you know , prepared a reading . " sex and the single mother . finding your g - spot . 
oh ! now it ' s a party !

oh no ! he ' s not getting away that easy !

oh how lame . . . oh , it ' s so tacky , and impersonal . 
oh , it ' s the worst way to propose ! 
hi . i just had the worst anniversary ever . 
well , mine was worse than that . 
we were at the game , and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing . . . 
well , that ' s what i said , but it turns out , mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night ! 
yeah , i really do ! yes , but , after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me , i don ' t think he ' s ever gonna ask again ! i mean , i said no in barbados and now this ! 
oh , i don ' t know , i don ' t know , isn ' t that a little desperate ? 
well , do you think i should propose ? 
ok , ok , so how should i do it ? 
yeah , that does make sense . ok , now , would . . . would you two like that ? 
no , i ' ve got work and then i ' m proposing . . 
uhuh , uhuh . . . 
i ' m not . i ' m praying . please let the knicks win . . . thank you thor ! where . . . where are you going ? 
well , i think you should wait . 
well , if you don ' t . . . if you don ' t hold it in , you don ' t get all the nutrients . 
mike hannigan . . . will you marry me ? 
that ' s not very enlightened ! 
hey , hey ! boo us ? boo you ! 
that woman at the game didn ' t know what she was talking about . mike , obviously you have balls . 
i would love it . consider it forgotten . . . but just so you know . . . however and whenever you decide to propose , i promise i ' ll say yes . whether . . . whether , you know , it is in a basketball game , or in sky writing , or you know , like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake . 
it ' s in the cake , isn ' t it ? 
what ' s the matter with me ? how do i keep ruining this ? i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry ! 
oh my god ! 
wait ! oh wait ! oh no ! 
uh - huh ! 
yes ! 
i love you more ! 
hey . . . 
oh , i ' m just so exhausted from dragging around this . . . huge engagement ring ! 
well , it was really sweet , and like the most romantic thing ever . 
thank you ! oh , and i have something for you ! 
it ' s , yes , my little black book . it ' s got the numbers of all the guys i ' ve dated . 
i would , but you ' re the last one . 
oh , my first love ! 
dead . oh , it ' s ok , no , he was old , yeah ! and he lived a full life , he was in the first wave at omaha beach . 
oh yes , they are . 
hey ! 
well , i told you i had to spend all the day clearing out stuff , so mike could move in . 
yeah . 
oh , it ' s so hard to get rid of stuff ! did you and chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together ? 
a bunch of stuff . and the worst one . . . he wants me to get rid of gladys . 
yeah . i really hate to give her up . oh , i know ! ! oh , you should take her ! 
why , you don ' t like her ? 
really ? you think ? 
ok , i ' ll fight for her . ok ! oh , wait , oh i just realized . . . if i do that , that means you don ' t get her . 
hi ! sorry , i ' m late . 
no , he really hates it . but he ' s gonna let me keep my box of human hair ! so you got to pick your battles . but the good news is , gladys is yours ! 
oh , she ' s that work of art i made , you know , with the woman coming out of the frame . 
oh , i didn ' t know you wanted her too ! 
girls , girls , stop , ok ? we ' ll flip a coin . heads , she ' s rachel ' s , tails she ' s monica ' s . . tails ! monica , she ' s yours ! 
well , gladys say hello to your new home ! 
yeah , yeah ! and you can get rid of that french poster . 
really ? it doesn ' t have anything coming out of it . or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom ? 
hey ! 
you guys ! you guys ! you don ' t have to fight over her anymore . whoever doesn ' t get gladys gets glynnis . 
i knew it ! 
hey ! 
it ' s really crazy ! the hall , the dress , the food . . . i - i had no idea how expensive this stuff was ! 
so what did you two do about it ? 
but really , it does seem like this money could be put to better use ? 
yeah ! now , how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall ? 
yes . we ' re here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children . 
well , i think you ' re gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one . 
and we don ' t want any recognition . this is completely anonymous . 
mr . x and phoebe buffay . 
buffay is spelled b - u - f - f - a - y . 
sure , i so glad we did this . it feels so good ! 
oh , look ! and we get these free t - shirts ! 
mhm . . . it ' s moist . 
hello , is this the creepy residence ? 
awe , this is so sweet of you ! but you know what ? i won ' t be needing a veil , i actually won ' t be wearing a dress at all ! 
no , no , no , we ' re not having a big reception , we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity . 
we , you know , we ' re different ! we don ' t care about having a huge party . this is really nice for you , but , oh , please , i put this on ? and , ow , i look , why , well , radiant . all right , well , who cares , i don ' t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress . 
city hall . 
it ' s ok , it ' s ok . i made my decision . what i really want is a great big wedding . 
well , i ' ll just ask for it back ! 
it ' s for our wedding day ! right , now , is this guy gay or straight , because one of us gonna have to start flirting . 
gay , go . 
the donation we made earlier , we k . . . , we w . . . , we want it back . 
yeah . see , that money was for a big wedding , that we thought we didn ' t want , but it turns out we do . 
i am sorry . i am , but this wedding is just really important to me . 
hey , that ' s not fair ! a person ' s wedding is important ! and especially to me ! ok ? i didn ' t have a graduation party ! and i didn ' t go to prom . and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to " kill me " or whatever . so i deserve a real celebration and i am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it . 
oh ! it ended okay . one of my friends shot him . 
yeah , i really do . you know , i had nothing growing up . just like the kids i took the money from . 
look , i can ' t have a wedding with this money now . it ' s tainted . 
and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time , my friend hasn ' t shot anyone in a really long time . 
we ' re back ! 
yeah , because you know what , it ' s . . . it ' s all about the children . 
although . . . it ' s also about the wedding . . . ugh , alright . . . here . no . . . oh god . . . oh ! 
but . . . but . . . but we ' re giving you this ! 
well , this is very generous ! 
oh , is that you ? 
hey ! 
hey ! 
well , personally i think it ' s great you ' re giving yourself a break . 
sure . it ' s just as well . . . i mean , last year wasn ' t very good . i think she ' s losing her touch . 
am i ? really ? am i ? well , why don ' t you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong ! well , think about it , think about it , you ' ll be trying to top than you did last year . you ' d be in competition . . . with yourself . 
hey ! 
oh , yeah , happy needless - turkey - murder day . 
you ' re not making the pies yourself ? 
hey rach .

oh . . . okay . 
okay , oh , and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition . 
well , i was thinking . . . 
yeah !

we can ' t leave now ! there was this one baby , haley , who was favourite to win and she got croup , so she had to stay home ! this competition just blew wide open , folks ! 
oh , i know , we should have been more prepared . it ' s okay . now , the way i see it , our real competition now is cameron . oh my god , they just took her sweater off . look at those arms ! hello michelin man . 
but emma ' s got what it takes , she could go all the way !

uh , we were at the spelling bee ! 
and it looks like she put makeup on her ! 
you guys , there are people in there who are not getting any happier ! 
alright , what are we gonna say ? 
oh , good , that ' s good , but you don ' t look like you were mugged ! 
we ' re just . . . we ' re trying to figure out an excuse . hey ! ooh ! how about this : we can say that monica told us 5 o ' clock , not 4 o ' clock . that way we ' re right on time ! or . . . or , we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her . 
well , i ' m not going in first . i bet that vein on monica ' s forehead is popping like crazy . 
oh , really ? does it beat water balloon ? . 
it ' s locked . 
what are we gonna do ? i ' m starving . 
oh yeah !

she died . 
yeah , last saturday . wow ! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic . oh , wait a minute , i read the wrong one . 
yeah , she was just an agent . 
well , we cannot tell joey about this . he ' s already flipping out about everything that ' s changing . this will push him over the edge . 
well , not for a little while . let ' s just give him a few days to get used to everything else . 
hey . everything ok ? 
estelle ? why ? 
i ' m guessing she does . 
well , no , no , wait , wait , wait . all right , i gotta go . just listen . promise me , that you will wait a minute before you call her . 
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason . 
joey , it ' s estelle . 
it ' s a little coincidental , but believable . . listen , i ' m sure you ' re wondering why i didn ' t get you an audition for that tv movie . 
i guess i dropped the ball there . whoopsie ! 
don ' t take that tone with me . who you think you are ? alan lemond , the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic ? 
what are you saying ?

hey joey , want come with me to . . . are you ok ? 
no , that wouldn ' t kill her . ordinary embolism might . 
no , no , no ! don ' t call her ! you wait for her to call you . 
because patience is the road to understanding which . . . is the key . . . to a happy heart . 
all right , so promise you ' re gonna wait for her to call you ? 
joey , it ' s estelle . 
yeah , i wanted to call and tell you that there ' s no hard feelings for firing me . 
well , i didn ' t think i should just drop by . . . 
anyway , you did what you had to do . i ' m okay . 
it ' s alright . look kiddo , i gotta go . good luck with the career . you ' re gonna be huge . 
hey ! 
oh , he has a gig . i kinda like being married to a rock star , you know . my husband has a gig .

uh - hmm .

i know . 
ok well , before you do , i know we weren ' t supposed to get you going away presents , but i do have something for you .

i love you too . please don ' t . . . don ' t turn into . . . you know . . . french bitch ! 
ok . 
are you wearing waterproof mascara ?

yeah ! 
these are not mine . . . look how flimsy they are , come on ! good god ! you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these , they ' ll snap like a piece of licorice . 
where do you think mike really is ? 
i don ' t know . but , god , joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well . 
you know , maybe she was just really spent from our talk . it was pretty intense . 
ross , if you ' re this upset , you should go and talk to her . 
tell me about it . 
all right , i think i ' m gonna head out . 
i thought i was going home to go to bed , but i ' m sensing there ' s something less fun for me to do here .

have you seen him throw a ball ? 
what ' s that smile ? did something happen with you two ? 
but do you wanna get back together ? 
yay !

oh , this is like the best day ever . ever ! you guys might get back together , monica and chandler are getting their baby , there are chicks and ducks in the world again ! oh , i feel like i ' m in a musical !

guess we ' ll never know how it ends . 
dive . yeah , they dove head - first into fun on the farm . 
ross , you ' ve got to tell her how you feel ! 
ross , rachel doesn ' t know that you wanna get back together . if she did , she might feel differently . she might not even go . 
i ' m telling you ! oh , okay ! this is the part of the musical where there ' d be a really good convincing song . " bam - bam , don ' t take no for an answer . bam - bam , don ' t let love fly away . bam - bam - bam - bam . . . "

uh , joe ? 
no , you don ' t ! she ' s going to paris ! she is going to meet somebody . do you know how many hot guys there are in paris ? it ' s . . . it ' s a city of gunthers ! 
hey ! what do you have there ? 
honey , that ' s gorgeous ! 
yeah , did she sound happy about it ? ' cause my friend ethel ' s baby was born with a teeny , tiny beard . 
hey . 
oh , jack bing . i love that . ooh , it sounds like a ' 40s newspaper guy , you know ? " jack bing , morning gazette . i ' m gonna blow this story wide open ! " 
oh yeah ? well , tell me which one , and i ' ll try slip it in my coat . 
one ? how about a whole bunch ? 
yeah ! ooh , we could teach them to sing , and we can be like the von trapp family ! only without the nazis . although that sounds kinda dull .

wait , wait ! get your coat ! get your coat ! 
you didn ' t bring one ! my cab ' s downstairs , i ' ll drive you to the airport .

my medallion number is , " get out of the cab ! " 
get out of the cab ! 
you can open your eyes now .

hurry ! 
okay . 
damn , that window is clean . 
ross , where are you going ?

you have to get a ticket to get past security . 
not with that attitude ! now , haul ass ! 
just one ? i drive you all the way down here , and i don ' t get to see how it works out ? 
we ' re on our honeymoon .

she ' s got her cell , you could call her . 
you don ' t have any other choice ! 
rachel ? oh , good . hey , by the way , did you just get on the plane ? 
for what it ' s worth , we would have caught her if we were at the right airport . 
uh , rach , hang on . 
uhm , actually no . no , you ' ve . . . you have to get off the plane . 
i have this feeling that something ' s wrong with it . something is wrong with the left philange . 
i don ' t see her .

rachel ! ! 
okay , you ' re on . 
i ' m sorry . 
hey .
