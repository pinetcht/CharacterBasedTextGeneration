Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear! 
Shape it up you guys!... Biggs? 
I didn't know you were back! When did you get in? 
The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission? 
I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look! 
There they are! 
But there was a lot of firing earlier... 
Hey, easy with those... 
Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city... 
Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet. 
What are you talking about? 
Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How? 
You're crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them. 
And I'm stuck here... 
Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead. 
I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now. 
It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock. 
I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long? 
Then I guess I won't see you. 
Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got. 
It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. 
But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... 
All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go. 
Uncle Owen... 
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! 
Uncle Owen... 
What about that one? 
Yeah, take it away. 
Okay, let's go. 
It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! 
Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! 
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. 
Uh, you can call me Luke. 
Hello. 
You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. 
You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? 
Have you been in many battles? 
Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... 
What's this? 
Who is she? She's beautiful. 
Is there more to this recording? 
Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? 
Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. 
I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing. 
H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. 
There you go. 
Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. 
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. 
Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. 
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. 
Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. 
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? 
He knew my father? 
Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. 
Sure, there're more than enough droids. 
But it's a whole 'nother year. 
Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. 
It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids. 
What are you doing hiding there? 
Oh, no! 
How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! 
It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. 
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. 
You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. 
Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well. 
Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator. 
Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? 
Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up. 
No, he's not going to try anything. 
What's wrong with him now? 
Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. 
There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now. 
What happened? 
Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! 
Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about? 
I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. 
You know him! 
Then the droid does belong to you. 
Threepio! 
Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. 
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? 
No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. 
You fought in the Clone Wars? 
I wish I'd known him. 
Sure, go ahead. 
What is it? 
How did my father die? 
The Force? 
I saw part of the message he was... 
I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. 
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. 
It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. 
These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. 
Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? 
If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! 
Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen! 
I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. 
About three or four seasons. 
Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. 
Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? 
I'm ready for anything. 
What? 
Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. 
I'm sorry. 
I'll be careful than. 
Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! 
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... 
That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. 
He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. 
What a piece of junk. 
Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. 
Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... 
What's that flashing? 
Are you all right? What's wrong? 
You mean it controls your actions? 
You don't believe in the Force, do you? 
You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. 
What's going on? 
What do you mean? Where is it? 
What? How? 
Maybe they know what happened. 
It followed us! 
It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. 
It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. 
Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. 
I have a very bad feeling about this. 
Why are we still moving towards it? 
But there's gotta be something you can do! 
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. 
You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. 
I want to go with you. 
But he can... 
Ben is a great man. 
I didn't hear you give any ideas... 
Who do you think... 
What is it? 
Well, who... who has he found? 
The princess? She's here? 
Oh, no! We've got to do something. 
The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her. 
But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block? 
They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. 
But they're going to kill her! 
She's rich. 
Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... 
Well more wealth that you can imagine. 
You'll get it! 
You will... 
All right. 
Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? 
Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. 
Okay. Han, you put these on. 
Lock the door! 
I can't see a thing in this helmet. 
Why didn't you say so before? 
Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight. 
He's going to pull us all apart. 
What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. 
I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. 
Come on! 
See-Threepio! See-Threepio! 
We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy! 
There isn't any other way out. 
Well, I didn't... 
No! wait! 
Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! 
There's something alive in here! 
Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? 
Help! 
Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. 
Anywhere! Oh!! 
I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared... 
The walls are moving! 
Wait a minute! 
Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be? 
Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! 
Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? 
Threepio! 
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. 
We're all right. You did great. 
Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? 
Well, let's get moving! 
See-Threepio, do you copy? 
We're right above you. Stand by. 
Where are you going? Come back! 
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! 
That oughta hold it for a while. 
Oh, I think I just blasted it. 
Here, hold this. 
Is the ship all right? 
Look! 
No! 
I can't believe he's gone. 
They're coming in too fast! 
Got him! I got him! 
I care! 
So... what do you think of her, Han? 
No! 
It's not impossible. I used to bull's- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. 
So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then? 
All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? 
Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. 
I only wish Ben were here. 
Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell... 
Thank you, sir. I'll try. 
I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs. 
Red Five standing by. 
This is Red Five; I'm going in! 
I got a little cooked, but I'm okay. 
I'm on my way in now... 
I'm on it. 
My scope's negative. I don't see anything. 
Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. 
Got him! 
I'm hit, but not bad. 
Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. 
I can't shake him! 
Blast it! Wedge where are you? 
Thanks, Wedge. 
No sign of any... wait! 
...oh-five; we'll cover for you. 
It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. 
Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! 
You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! 
You can't do any more good back there! 
Artoo, try and increase the power! 
I've lost Artoo! 
Oh, no! 
He'll be all right. 
Hey, steady girl.  What's the matter?  You smell something? 
Aaargh! 
Dagobah system? 
Dagobah system... 
Dagobah... 
Thanks to you. 
Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. 
Thanks. 
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? 
Yeah. 
You, too. 
Just like new, Dack.  How about you? 
Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern delta.  Go now! 
All right, I'm coming in. 
That armor's too strong for blasters. 
Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get ready to fire that tow cable. 
Dack?  Dack! 
Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff. 
Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going, we're going. 
No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll have a look around. 
Artoo? 
Artoo!  Where are you? 
Artoo!  You be more careful. 
Artoo - that way! 
Artoo! 
Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come on.  You're lucky you don't taste very good.  Anything broken? 
If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here?  It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy. 
Ready for some power?  Okay. Let's see now.  Put that in there.  There you go. 
Still... there's something familiar about this place.  I feel like... I don't know... 
I'm looking for someone. 
I don't think so.  I'm looking for a great warrior. 
Put that down.  Hey!  That's my dinner! 
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... 
Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're making a mess.  Hey, give me that! 
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. 
Oh, Artoo, let him have it! 
Artoo! 
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master. 
You know him? 
Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo. 
Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. 
How far away is Yoda?  Will it take us long to get there? 
Mostly because of my father, I guess. 
Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm ready. 
But I've learned so much. 
I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. 
Vader.  Is the dark side stronger? 
But how am I to know the good side from the bad? 
But tell me why I can't... 
There's something not right here. 
I feel cold, death. 
What's in there? 
Oh, no.  We'll never get it out now. 
Master, moving stones around is one thing.  This is totally different. 
I don't... I don't believe it. 
Han!  Leia! 
I saw... I saw a city in the clouds. 
They were in pain. 
Future?  Will they die? 
I've got to go to them. 
I can't keep the vision out of my head.  They're my friends.  I've got to help them. 
But Han and Leia will die if I don't. 
But I can help them!  I feel the Force! 
But I've learned so much since then.  Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. 
And that is why I have to go. 
You won't. 
And sacrifice Han and Leia? 
I will.  And I'll return.  I promise. 
You'll find I'm full of surprises. 
No! 
I'll never join you! 
He told me enough!  It was you who killed him. 
No.  No.  That's not true! That's impossible! 
No!  No!  No! 
Ben... Ben, please! 
Ben.  Leia! 
Hear me!  Leia! 
Oh, Leia. 
Father. 
It's Vader. 
Ben, why didn't you tell me? 
Ow! 
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well. 
I must speak with Jabba. 
You will take me to Jabba now! 
You serve your master well. 
And you will be rewarded. 
I must be allowed to speak. 
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. 
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. 
Han! 
Are you all right? 
Wouldn't miss it. 
The same as always. 
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make. 
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. 
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. 
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. 
Easy, Chewie. 
Get the gun! Point it at the deck! 
Point it at the deck! 
Come on! 
Let's go! And don't forget the droids. 
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it. 
I'll see you back at the fleet. 
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend. 
I'll meet you back at the fleet. 
I will. 
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend. 
No... of course not. 
Master Yoda, you can't die. 
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. 
Then I am a Jedi? 
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? 
Yoda, I must know. 
Yes. 
Unfortunate that I know the truth? 
Well, I'm sorry. 
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. 
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? 
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. 
A certain point of view! 
There's still good in him. 
I can't do it, Ben. 
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. 
But I had to help my friends. 
I found out Darth Vader was my father. 
I can't kill my own father. 
Yoda spoke of another. 
But I have no sister. 
Leia! Leia's my sister. 
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her. 
Ask me again sometime. 
Hi, Han... Chewie. 
Yeah, she's comin' up. 
All set. 
Vader's on that ship. 
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. 
Quietly, there might be more of them out there. 
Great. Come on. 
I see them. Wait, Leia! 
Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! 
Move closer! 
Get alongside that one! 
Get him! 
Keep on that one! I'll take these two! 
What? She didn't come back? 
We got separated. 
Hey, we better go look for her. 
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners. 
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this. 
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't! 
Han, don't. It'll be all right. 
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. 
Do you understand anything they're saying? 
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. 
Just tell them. 
Thanks, Threepio. 
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? 
What do you remember? 
Tell me. 
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. 
Vader is here...now, on this moon. 
He's my father. 
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. 
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. 
Yes. It's you Leia. 
Then you know why I have to face him. 
No, you don't. You've always been strong. 
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. 
I know, father. 
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. 
Come with me. 
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. 
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate. 
Then my father is truly dead. 
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. 
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me. 
Your overconfidence is your weakness. 
No! 
I will not fight you, father. 
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. 
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. 
I will not fight you. 
Never-r-r! 
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. 
Father, please. Help me. 
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. 
Father...I won't leave you.
